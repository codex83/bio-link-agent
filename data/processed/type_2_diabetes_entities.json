    "abstract": "For the past 80 years, the effect of the Mediterranean diet on overall health has been a constant topic of interest among medical and scientific researchers. Parallel with the persistent global rise of cases of type 2 diabetes, many studies conducted in the past 20 years have shown the benefits of the Mediterranean lifestyle for people with, or at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, despite the large body of evidence, concerns exist amongst scientists regarding the reliability of the data related to this topic. This review offers a glimpse of the onset of the Mediterranean diet and follows its significant impact on the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. There is a constant rise in type 2 diabetes cases on the Balkan Peninsula and North Macedonia in particular. Having in mind that North Macedonia, as well as most of the countries on the Balkans have low to middle income, there is a need for a certain affordable dietary pattern to ameliorate the rise in diabetes incidence, as well as improve the glycemic control. We did a review based on the available literature regarding Mediterranean diet and people with or at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, its effects on glycemic control, lipid profile and metabolic outcome.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a significant health problem. Many studies have reported that intensive nutritional intervention by itself or in addition to medications is the best method to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, in clinical practice, dietary education is not implemented as an integral part in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyse the scientific evidence concerning the role of nutritional intervention in the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: We searched Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from inception till May 2019 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that include dietary interventions in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nRESULTS: A total of 28 studies were included. Our results demonstrated that lifestyle interventions significantly lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA) levels compared to the usual care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, overall weighted mean difference, WMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.51 (-\u20090.67, -\u20090.35). Strategies combining individualized and group-based activities were the most effective, WMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.95 (-\u20091.24, -\u20090.66). Most of stratified analyses did not totally resolve heterogeneity, but improvement in HbA levels has been consistently observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The available evidence from RCTs shows that lifestyle intervention is more effective than the standard care regarding the glycaemic control of type 2 diabetic patients, particularly when there is a weight loss. It is time to translate this evidence to the primary health care practice. The protocol of the present systematic review was registered in PROSPERO, registration number CRD42018090469.",

We have investigated the total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), and glucose (CHG) index for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus index which is derived from fasting state. In this study we aimed to compare the accuracy of with CHG index and triglycerides (TG) and glucose levels (TyG) as surrogates of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: A total of 9,704 individuals between 35 and 65\u2009years of age were recruited as part of the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder (MASHAD) study. They were categorized into two groups, those with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cut-off in groups to detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus was fasting blood glucose \u2265126\u2009mg/dL in blood sample. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish the cut-off of indices to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of them.\nRESULTS: The best cut-off of CHG index for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 5.57 which was associated with a sensitivity of 70.38% and specificity of 89.82% values. This was in comparison to the TyG index. LR+ CHG index was 6.91 compared to 3.47 for the TyG index and the AUC of CHG index was 0.864 (0.857, 0.871) compared with 0.825 (0.818, 0.833) for the TyG index. This indicates that the CHG index has a higher efficiency value to diagnose of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nCONCLUSIONS: The CHG index could be useful for the detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus with its high morbidity and mortality becomes an important health problem. The multifactorial etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus is relative to many gene and molecule alterations, and increased insulin resistance. Besides these, however, there are still other predisposing and risk factors accounting for type 2 diabetes mellitus not to be identified and recognized. Emerging evidence indicated that defects in galanin function played a crucial role in development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Galanin homeostasis is tightly relative to insulin resistance and is regulated by blood glucose. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinism, enhanced plasma galanin levels and decreased galanin receptor activities are some of the characters of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The discrepancy between high insulin level and low glucose handling is named as insulin resistance. Similarly, the discrepancy between high galanin level and low glucose handling may be denominated as galanin resistance too. In this review, the characteristic milestones of type 2 diabetes mellitus were condensed as two analogical conceptual models, obesity-hyper-insulin-insulin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity-hyper-galanin-galanin resistance-type 2 diabetes mellitus. Both galanin resistance and insulin resistance are correlative with each other. Conceptualizing the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus as a disorder of galanin resistance may inspire a new concept to deepen our knowledge about pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, eventually leading to novel preventive and therapeutic interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy alimentary habits lead to obesity, boosting both glucose and fatty acid in the bloodstream and eventually, insulin resistance, pancreas inflammation and faulty insulin production or secretion, all of them very well-defined hallmarks of type 2 diabetes mellitus. miRNAs are small sequences of non-coding RNA that may regulate several processes within the cells, fine-tuning protein expression, with an unexpected and subtle precision and in time-frames ranging from minutes to days. Since the discovery of miRNA and their possible implication in pathologies, several groups aimed to find a relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and miRNAs. Here we discuss the pattern of expression of different miRNAs in cultured cells, animal models and diabetic patients. We summarize the role of the most important miRNAs involved in pancreas growth and development, insulin secretion and liver, skeletal muscle or adipocyte insulin resistance in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Deviations from optimal choices in seeking satisfying options are known as decision-making biases, which are not obvious in the self-care behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Qualitative research can provide insights into patients' descriptions of and experiences in self-care, aiding in systematically identifying decision-making biases.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify the decision-making biases of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from their descriptions of and experiences in self-care to guide targeted strategies for supplementing existing intervention paradigms.\nDESIGN: Qualitative, descriptive design.\nPARTICIPANTS: We used purposive sampling to recruit 18 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus at the endocrinology outpatient unit of a large urban general hospital in Lanzhou, China, between July and September 2023.\nMETHODS: We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews to identify decision-making biases of self-care behaviours from the behavioural economics perspective. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the thematic analysis approach was utilized to code the transcribed data and identify themes.\nRESULTS: We found that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed emotion-driven and short-term-oriented decision-making biases regarding self-maintenance. Self-monitoring decisions tend to be personal experiences and based on individual perceptions. Self-management decisions depend heavily on accessibility to and sources of information.\nCONCLUSIONS: Decision-making biases clearly impact the self-care behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We identified 10 decision-making biases related to self-care behaviour maintenance, monitoring, and management, suggesting that future research can leverage these biases to improve the health-related behaviours of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

The relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity is well established, and surgical treatment is widely used for obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim was to present current knowledge about the possible mechanisms responsible for glucose control after surgical procedures and to review the surgical treatment results.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical literature was searched for the articles presenting the impact of surgical treatment on glycemic control, long-term results, and possible mechanisms of action among obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nRESULTS: Remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery depends on the definition of the remission used. Complete remission rate after surgery with the new criteria is lower than was considered before. Randomized controlled studies demonstrate that surgery is superior to best medical treatment for the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The recurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus after bariatric surgery is observed in up to 40% of cases with \u2265 5 years of follow-up. Despite the recurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in this group, better glycemic control and lower risk of macrovascular complications are present. Incretin effects on glycemic control after bariatric surgery are well described, but the role of other possible mechanisms (bile acids, microbiota, intestinal gluconeogenesis) in humans is unclear.\nCONCLUSION: Surgery is an effective treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese patients. The most optimal surgical procedure for the treatment of obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is still to be established. More research is needed to explore the mechanisms of glycemic control after bariatric surgery.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus, is a disease with a rising prevalence worldwide. It is currently estimated that 190 million people around the world suffer from diabetes mellitus, with over 330 million predicted to have the condition by 2025 and 366 million by the year 2030. It is predicted that the developing countries will contribute 77.6% of the total number of diabetic patients in the world by the year 2030. This rapidly growing prevalence among developing countries is attributed to the effects of urbanization, industrialization and globalization on these countries. There has been substantial progress over the last decade in the development of new agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes especially focusing on the underlying pathophysiology. Despite this and the numerous guidelines from diabetes organisations only less than 40% of patients achieve recommended glycaemic targets. We therefore decided to do a review of the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus to highlight the pharmacology and effectiveness of these agents and their roles in the management of type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the literature on the subject using materials from library search, articles in journals, internet search and conference abstracts.\nRESULTS: The global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the various pharmacological agents available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, including novel agents were discussed.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide and the predicted increase is much higher in developing countries compared to the developed countries. There are obviously an enormous number of therapies available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and if effectively deployed it will be possible to achieve target diabetic control in most of our patients. This however, should not detract us from adopting measures that will reduce the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in our population bearing in mind that prevention is more cost effective especially given our low socioeconomic development and the very high predicted rise in the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus in our developing world.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean region.\nINTRODUCTION: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Caribbean is of significant concern. Poor management of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risks of complications and death. Several studies have been conducted to explore the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean; however, a systematic review has yet to be conducted.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible participants were adults (aged 18 and above) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, their families/carers, and health care professionals whose work involves the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Caribbean. The review included studies that focused on their views, experiences, attitudes, understandings, perceptions, and perspectives regarding the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management.\nMETHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL/BNI (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science, and Scopus were conducted from database inception to March 2020. Additionally, gray literature was searched via EThOS, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. JBI methodology for conducting qualitative systematic reviews was followed. Screening of studies, assessment of methodological quality, and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Findings from studies were synthesized using a meta-aggregation approach, and confidence in the findings was ranked using the ConQual approach.\nRESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review, all of which focused on patients' perspectives. There were five synthesized findings, including i) cultural demands and pressures impact self-management and general care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (low confidence evidence); ii) support systems' influence on the general management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (moderate confidence evidence); iii) personal and environmental background/circumstances can encourage and limit good self-management and general management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (high confidence evidence); iv) psychological factors that influence patients' actions towards the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (moderate confidence evidence); and v) psychological factors and their influence on patients' adherence to type 2 diabetes mellitus management (low confidence evidence).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients in the Caribbean have multiple barriers and facilitators that limit and promote effective management of their type 2 diabetes mellitus. Identifying the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean will assist with development of effective type 2 diabetes mellitus management programs. However, further qualitative studies on barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean that target health care professionals and families/carers should be conducted.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION NUMBER: PROSPERO CRD42018097242.",

    "abstract": "One of the leading geriatric syndromes, which has been included in the International Classification of Diseases ICD-10 since 2016, is sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a progressive gener-alized disease accompanied by a loss of strength, mass, and skeletal muscle function. This dis-ease can lead to a decrease in working capacity, impaired ability to self-service, disability, and an increased risk of premature death. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) plays an important role among the chronic non-infectious pathology of elderly and senile patients. T2DM is a serious health burden for older people, affecting approximately 25% of people over 65 years of age. This percentage is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades due to the increase in the life expectancy of the population observed in recent years. In addition to microvascular and macro-vascular complications, sarcopenia has been described as a new complication of diabetes melli-tus in the elderly. T2DM increases the risk of developing sarcopenia threefold. It is of interest to consider the mechanisms of the relationship between sarcopenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus in geriatric patients.",

    "abstract": "The association between birth weight and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been debated for several decades. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to quantitatively clarify the association between birth weight and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus based on cohort studies. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for cohort study articles on the association between birth weight and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus published up to 1 March 2018. Random effects of generalized least square regression models were used to estimate relative risk (RR). Restricted cubic splines were conducted to model the dose-response relationship. We included 21 studies (19 articles) involving 1\u00a0041\u00a0879 individuals and 35\u00a0699 cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with follow-up ranged from 6 to 47\u00a0years. We identified significant decreasing trend for the highest versus lowest category of birth weight for the association with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk: The risk was reduced by 35% (RR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.81) and by 12% (RR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91) per 500-g increment in birth weight. Our results showed a dose-response relationship between birth weight and diabetes risk, which was nonlinear (P \u00a0<\u00a00.001) and L-shaped. With increasing birth weight (<5000\u00a0g), the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased substantially. The association between birth weight and type 2 diabetes mellitus was curvilinear and L-shaped.",

    "year": "2021",
    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a major, global problem. Among the numerous complications of diabetes, there is increasing concern over the coexisting heart failure. Metformin is the most frequently used oral antidiabetic drug that is considered to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Since the publication of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, it has been suggested that metformin might improve cardiovascular prognoses. Results from available studies have shown that metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared with other oral antidiabetic agents, insulin, or lifestyle management. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating the influence of metformin use on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure. New evidence from large cardiovascular outcome trials that showed a reduction in heart failure hospitalization for SGLT2 inhibitors caused changes in recommendations on the management of hyperglycaemia. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology recommends sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure or at high risk for heart failure, as a first choice in drug na\u00efve patients, or as a second drug if the patient is already on metformin. The aim of our study is to review the current state of knowledge about the position of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure.",

Both of these immune conditions are implicated in the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The authors performed a systematic review to summarize findings from the current literature on the association between history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Ten case-control studies and three prospective cohort studies were included in this review. Meta-analysis found that a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was positively associated with overall non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies. Study design was an important source of heterogeneity. The rate ratio between type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was found to be 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.42) among case-control studies and 1.79 (95% confidence interval: 1.30, 2.47) among the prospective cohort studies. Weaknesses were identified in some of the included studies in the areas of case and control selection, measurement of covariates and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and confounding control. Although a positive association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was suggested, the evidence is inconclusive because of methodological limitations of the included case-control studies. More prospective studies with improved control of confounding are needed to confirm these findings.",

Moreover, tumour progression at hyperinsulinemia is more rapid and tumour-associated mortality is increased. Colorectal cancer can be avoided by screening. Recommendations for colorectal cancer screening should employ the recent epidemiologic evidence. All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be recommended to undergo colonoscopy before starting insulin therapy, and screening intervals should not exceed 5 years.

Genetic mutations, obesity and lack of physical activity constitute the possible factors that can lead to onset and progression of this disorder. However, there is another major factor that can be the root cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus and that is an imbalance in the microorganisms that inhabit the gut. The gut microbiome is a vital component that needs to be given significant attention because any \"dysbiosis\" in the colonic microorganisms can transform the host from a state of health to a state of disease. This transformation is quite obvious since the gut barrier integrity, host metabolism such as sensitivity to insulin and maintaining blood glucose level are carried out by the tiny organisms inhabiting our intestine. In fact, the normal functioning of the human body is accredited to the microbes, particularly the bacteria, because they generate their metabolites that communicate with host cells and maintain normal physiology. Giving importance to gut health is, therefore, necessary to prevent metabolic diseases that can be maintained by the intake of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics along with healthy diet. The tiny microorganisms in the gut that keep our body free of disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus need to be in a state of 'eubiosis', else the consequences of disturbance in gut microbes can progress to serious complications in the host.",

Berberine, a traditional Chinese herb extract, has been shown to be safe and effective in lowering blood sugar, alleviating insulin resistance and moderating type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications. The bioavailability of berberine is extremely low, suggesting that it may play a role in lowering blood sugar and lipid by regulating intestinal flora. Intestinal microbiota may serve as a new potential target for berberine treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "year": "2023",
    "abstract": "Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus are usually associated with meta-inflammation. \u03b2-cell failure is a marked feature observed in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous situation that is accompanied by not only defective insulin secretion but also peripheral insulin resistance. \u03b2-cells are the primary organ for insulin secretion; hence, it is crucial to maintain a significant \u03b2-cell mass in response to a variety of changes. Insulin resistance is a chief cause of T2DM, leading to increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, which in turn elevates \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion as compensation for insulin insensitivity. It has recently been established that amplified numbers of innate immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines result in detrimental effects on islets in chronic conditions. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is the lymphokine that prevents arbitrary migration of macrophages and assembles macrophages at inflammatory loci. Inflammation is known to trigger monocytes to differentiate into macrophages. Progress of complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as indicated through recent findings, is also dependent on the buildup of macrophages in tissues vulnerable to diabetic injury. The present article scientifically evaluates the present knowledge concerning the mechanisms of monocyte and macrophage-mediated injury recruitment in complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It also describes some of the established and experimental therapies that might bring about a reduction in these inflammatory complications. Recent discoveries in the field of drug delivery have facilitated phenotype-specific targeting of macrophages. This review highlights the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, how macrophage induces type 2 diabetes mellitus and potential therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus via macrophage-specific delivery.",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between low social support and risk for depression in people with type 2 diabetes through a meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: PubMed, ProQuest, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for English-language articles published up to 2021. Pooled adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated using a random-effect model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was evaluated by using the Cochrane Q test and I2 statistics. The risk of publication bias was estimated using a funnel plot, the Egger test, and the Begg test. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess the quality of evidence and the risk of bias.\nRESULTS: Eleven studies were included in this meta-analysis, containing a total of 3151 people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pooled analysis showed that people with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had low social support had twice as high a risk of depression as those with high social support (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.70; p&lt;0.001).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the context of a move to universal health coverage, three separate systematic reviews were conducted to summarise available evidence on the direct costs of interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease in South Africa.\nMETHODS: PubMed\u00ae and Web of Science was searched for literature published between 01 and 1995 and 27 October 2022. Additionally, reference and citations lists of retrieved articles and experts were consulted. We also tracked reference lists of previous, related systematic reviews. Eligible publications were cost analyses of clinical interventions targeted at adults age 15\u2009+\u2009reporting primary estimates of in- and out-of-hospital costs from a provider perspective. Costs were extracted and converted to 2021 US dollars, and article methodological and reporting quality was appraised using the 2013 CHEERS checklist.\nRESULTS: Of the 600, 1,172 and 1,466 identified publications for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, respectively, 10, 12, and 17 met full inclusion criteria. 60% of articles reported cardiovascular disease costs, 52% were of good reporting quality, and 10%, 50%, and 39% of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease papers reported private-sector costs only. Hypertension drug costs ranged from $2 to $85 per person-month, while type 2 diabetes mellitus drug costs ranged between $57 and $630 per person-year (ppy). Diabetes-related complication treatment costs ranged from $55 for retinopathy treatment to $25,193 ppy for haemodialysis, while cardiovascular disease treatment costs were between $160 and $37,491 ppy. Drugs and treatment of complications were major cost drivers for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, while hospitalisation drove cardiovascular disease costs.\nCONCLUSION: The intervention costs of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease care have received more attention recently, particularly diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular disease. However, 39% of identified cardiovascular disease treatment costs used a private sector perspective, leaving significant research gaps in the public sector and the cheaper to treat hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review fills an information gap regarding the intervention costs of these diseases in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has been increasing worldwide. As the therapeutic options for type 2 diabetes mellitus have evolved over the last 2 decades, national and global guidelines related to type 2 diabetes mellitus pharmacotherapy issued by various organizations have tended to vary in their recommendations. This narrative review aimed to analyze the key recommendations by major global and national guidelines on the initiation of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus over the last 20 years. Strategies for insulin therapy for titration and intensification were also assessed. All guidelines recommend initiation of insulin (basal/ premixed/other formulations) when glycemic targets are not achieved despite lifestyle measures and oral antidiabetic drugs. In the recent decade, early initiation of insulin has been recommended when the glycated hemoglobin levels are >10% or blood glucose levels are \u2265300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L). Initiation is recommended at a dose of 10 units or 0.1-0.2 U/kg. Titration is advised to achieve the optimal dosage, while intensification is recommended when glycemic targets are not achieved despite titrating to an acceptable level. Glucose monitoring at periodic intervals is recommended for adequate glycemic control. The guidelines further suggest that the choice of insulin should be individualized, considering the clinical status of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The physicians as well as patients should be a part of the decisions made regarding the therapeutic choice of regimen, preparation, and delivery device.",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of premature death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and end-stage renal disease. Hypertension is an extremely common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The coexistence of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes is particularly destructive because of the strong linkage of the two conditions with CVD, stroke, progression of renal disease, and diabetic nephropathy. Current guidelines, including those issued by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, the National Kidney Foundation, and the American Diabetes Association, provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, studies indicate that guidelines are not widely followed. Therefore, the beneficial effects of appropriate hypertension treatment observed in clinical trials are often not recognized in clinical practice. Pharmacists are ideally positioned to help improve guideline implementation and patient outcome.\nCONCLUSION: Pharmacists must become more vigilant about following current guidelines for the treatment of patients with concomitant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Strategies such as patient education and medication assessment can help to optimize care for these patients and slow the progression to diabetic nephropathy.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased worldwide over the past decades. The economic and social cost associated with diabetes mellitus and its complications have also increased enormously. Since current methods of treating diabetes is inadequate, the most effective way to reduce the burden associated with type 2 diabetes would be to prevent diabetes itself. Current strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus are based on efforts to reduce insulin resistance and to preserve or increase pancreatic beta cell function in high risk individuals. Now there is substantial evidence that life style intervention or pharmacologic agents can reduce the development of diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, it remains to be determined whether the result would be similar in other risk groups for type 2 diabetes. Although development of type 2 diabetes mellitus is influenced by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, current prevention strategies do not reflect contribution of genetic factors. Over the past decade, many investigators tried to find diabetogenic genes by traditional gene discovery methods. It appears that multiple genes with weak effect are involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus which makes searching diabetogenic genes more complicated. In addition to the completion of human genome project, new genetic tools to identify genetic variations and analyze gene to gene or gene to environmental interaction will facilitate the discovery of susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus in near future. Once we could identify susceptibility genes and gene to environmental interaction of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we can clarify the role of both environmental and genetic factors in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, we can identify people who can get more benefit from prevention and also can provide better and personalized preventive measure based on genetic information.",

A nonsystematic literature search was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and ScienceDirect to identify clinical evidence from different parts of the world, evaluating the use of whole-medical systems and/or holistic care interventions in clinical practice for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Relevant keywords were used in the search. Data were analyzed using content analysis and simple descriptive statistics (percentages). Most of the studies (64%) were mainly conducted in Eastern countries (India, China and Israel) while 36% of the studies were conducted in the Western countries (USA, Netherlands, Canada and Mexico). Lifestyle medicine and integrated naturopathy were shown to be the commonly used whole-medical systems for type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Significant improvements in type 2 diabetes parameters, medication use, other symptoms, and overall feeling of wellness were observed in all studies. This review study revealed limited utilization and/or documentation of whole-medical systems or holistic care treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus in regions of the world other than eastern countries. Lifestyle medicine, naturopathy, yoga, Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine were shown to be effective for type 2 diabetes mellitus, either as an alternative or as a complementary therapy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a global health concern with significant complications and mortality rates. Black older adults are disproportionately affected. Initially designed for type 1 diabetes, continuous glucose monitoring has emerged as an innovative tool for type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Despite its potential, there are challenges related to adherence and digital literacy among Black older adults for managing Diabetes.\nDESIGN: A discursive review.\nMETHODS: Searching literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for papers published from 2017 to 2023, we explored the use of continuous glucose monitoring in Black older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, examining barriers, facilitators and challenges.\nDISCUSSION: We highlight recommendations from the literature which included barriers, facilitators, and cultural factors associated with continuous glucose monitoring use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing these challenges to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in type 2 diabetes mellitus management among Black older adults. Nurses and advanced practice registered nurses are at the forefront and can play a pivotal role in exploring and implementing interventions to promote access and proper use of continuous glucose monitoring among Black older adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

There are very few researches from Nepal that have evaluated the association of type-2 diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions among type-2 diabetes mellitus patients.\nMETHODS: This was cross-sectional study conducted among 204 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients visiting the internal medicine department of a tertiary center located in Kathmandu, Nepal.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of thyroid disorders in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus was 27.94%. Subclinical hypothyroidism, which occurred in 14.71% of patients, was the most common thyroid disorder. The longer duration of diabetes, more than ten years, was associated with the increased thyroid disorders (p=0.025). The poor glycemic control, HbA1c \u2265 7%, was associated with significantly increased prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients (p=0.002). Female patients had higher prevalence of thyroid disorders than males, but this association was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of thyroid disorders among patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus highlights the importance of screening type-2 diabetes mellitus patients for the presence of thyroid disorders.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus has become one of the fastest growing public health problems worldwide. The disease is believed to involve a complex process involving genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The human intestine harbors hundreds of trillions of bacteria, as well as bacteriophage particles, viruses, fungi, and archaea, which constitute a complex and dynamic ecosystem referred to as the gut microbiota. Increasing evidence has indicated changes in the gut microbiota composition or function in type 2 diabetic patients. An analysis of 'dysbiosis' enables the detection of alterations in the specific bacteria, clusters of bacteria, or bacterial functions associated with the occurrence of type 2 diabetes. These bacteria are involved predominantly in the control of inflammation and energy homeostasis. This review attempts to show that the gut microbiota are important factors for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and are important for the treatment of gut microbiota dysbiosis through bariatric surgery, fecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics, and probiotics.",

    "year": "2022",
    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as common metabolic diseases, are pathologically characterized by overnutrition and insulin resistance (IR), which subsequently lead to glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. The liver, a major metabolic organ of the body, integrates hormone and metabolic signals to regulate the synthesis of lipids and glucose as well as their transport to peripheral tissues, hence playing an essential role in the development of obesity and T2DM. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central regulator involved in cellular and organismal metabolism in eukaryotes, which activates processes that produce ATP and diminishes its consumption. In addition, AMPK also regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and promotes autophagy, both of which are associated with the pathogenesis of IR. Therefore, increasing AMPK activity is considered a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity and T2DM. In this review, we summarize the role of hepatic AMPK in obesity and T2DM and the potential of using AMPK activators as therapeutics for metabolic disorders.",

    "year": "2002",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered an exclusive disease of adulthood until the late 1970s, when reports of an increased prevalence in the pediatric age group emerged in the literature. The concerning upswing in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has continued, parallel to the increasing rates of obesity. The disease is not specific to the U.S.; it has proven to be a global problem. The current information on type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents is mostly extrapolated from studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, due to the paucity of studies conducted in youth. Obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, minority ethnicity and race, polycystic ovary syndrome, maternal diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during gestation, and acanthosis nigricans are the major risk factors and markers of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiology, which involves both an insulin secretion defect and resistance to insulin, needs further clarification in pediatric studies. Current management approaches involve lifestyle modification (nutritional and exercise) along with pharmacologic agents, such as insulin and oral antihyperglycemic medications, as indicated. A recent study on the use of metformin in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated the drug to be effective and to have a good safety profile in this population. However, the outcomes of ongoing studies and future studies focusing on type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group will be crucial in terms of fine-tuning management plans and setting up appropriate prevention strategies.",

Besides bone, OPG and RANKL are also produced in adipose tissue and may be involved in the inflammatory process associated with obesity. Metabolically healthy obesity has been associated with lower circulating OPG concentrations, possibly representing a counteracting mechanism, while elevated serum OPG levels may reflect an increased risk of metabolic dysfunction or cardiovascular disease. OPG and RANKL have been also proposed as potential regulators of glucose metabolism and are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In clinical terms, type 2 diabetes mellitus has been consistently associated with increased serum OPG concentrations. With regard to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, experimental data suggest a potential contribution of OPG and RANKL in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis; however, most clinical studies showed reduction in serum concentrations of OPG and RANKL. The emerging contribution of the OPG-RANKL-RANK axis to the pathogenesis of obesity and its associated comorbidities warrants further investigation by mechanistic studies and may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate the characteristics of the circulating microRNA expression profile in type 2 diabetic patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease by systematic evaluation and meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: The literatures up to March 2022 related to circulating microRNA and acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus were searched and screened from multiple databases. The NOS quality assessment scale was used to evaluate methodological quality. Heterogeneity tests and statistical analyses of all data were performed by Stata 16.0. The differences in microRNA levels between groups were illustrated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).\nRESULTS: A total of 49 studies on 12 circulating miRNAs were included in this study, including 486 cases of type 2 diabetes complicated with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease and 855 controls. Compared with the control group (T2DM group), miR-200a, miR-144, and miR-503 were upregulated and positively correlated with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Their comprehensive SMD and 95% CI were 2.71 (1.64~3.77), 5.77 (4.28~7.26) and 0.73 (0.27~1.19), respectively. MiR-126 was downregulated and negatively correlated with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, its comprehensive SMD and 95% CI were -3.64 (-5.56~-1.72).\nCONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease, the expression of serum miR-200a, miR-503, plasma and platelet miR-144 was upregulated and the expression of serum miR-126 was downregulated. It may have diagnostic value in the early identification of type 2 diabetes mellitus with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease.",

Heart failure occurs in diabetic patients even in the absence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, or valvular heart disease, and is, therefore, a major cardiovascular complication in this vulnerable population. Given the continued rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide, the burden of heart failure on the healthcare system will continue to increase. Recent evidence demonstrates that empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, brings clinical benefit to patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein, we critically reviewed the clinical evidence of empagliflozin for patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus with the comparison with other sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and potential mechanism to provide the optimal and evidence-based management for patients with established heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus with the goal to be conducive to the mechanism exploration of empagliflozin to advance a more comprehensive understanding of empagliflozin.",

    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of people are developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, but interventions to prevent and treat the classic microvascular and macrovascular complications have improved, so that people are living longer with the condition. This trend means that novel complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are not targeted by current management strategies, could start to emerge. Cognitive impairment and dementia could come into this category. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with a 1.5-2.5-fold increased risk of dementia. The etiology of dementia and cognitive impairment in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is probably multifactorial. Chronic hyperglycemia is implicated, perhaps by promoting the development of cerebral microvascular disease. Data suggest that the brains of older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus might be vulnerable to the effects of recurrent, severe hypoglycemia. Other possible moderators of cognitive function include inflammatory mediators, rheological factors and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Cognitive function should now be included as a standard end point in randomized trials of therapeutic interventions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

However, few such studies were carried out in China. The present study examined the spatial association between the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and neighborhood deprivation in Zhejiang, China, from a spatial epidemiology perspective.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus data (2012-2016) in the present study were derived from a population-based diabetes registry system maintained by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Principal components analysis was used to combine different socioeconomic variables together into a composited Neighborhood Deprivation Index. We applied the global Moran's I and Anselin's local Moran's I statistics to explore the spatial patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence and Neighborhood Deprivation Index.\nRESULTS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence (Moran's I: 0.531, P < 0.001) and Neighborhood Deprivation Index (Moran's I: 0.772, P < 0.001) showed positive statistically significant global Moran's I index values, showing a tendency towards clustering. The local Moran's I analyses showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence hot spots were mainly located in urban centers, and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence cold spots appeared in the provincial capital area (Hangzhou city) and western and south-western regions of Zhejiang; the hot spots of the less deprived areas were concentrated in urban centers (except Lishui city), and the cold spots of the most deprived areas were clustered in western and south-western regions of Zhejiang.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher in affluent areas than the deprived areas across the study period. It will be significant to focus preventive efforts on the least deprived areas.",

    "title": "Concept analysis: self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
    "year": "2008",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The term self-monitoring is often used in the literature on type 2 diabetes mellitus management. The term is generally used to refer to patients measuring their blood glucose levels with a glucose meter. However, for patients with diabetes mellitus to effectively manage their disease they need to effectively monitor and respond to a much broader set of signs and symptoms than blood glucose levels only. Patient's awareness of this wider set of diabetes manifestations, as well as their ability to interpret and respond to those manifestations, is influenced by subjective life experiences and individual cultural contexts.\nAIM: The aim of this paper is to delineate, clarify and redefine the concept of self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes mellitus from a broad perspective which includes consideration of patients' subjective experience and cultural contexts.\nMETHOD: Rodgers Evolutionary Method was used to delineate and clarify the \"concept\" of self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched for the years 2002-2007, limited to published English literature involving humans.\nRESULTS: Self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes mellitus was composed of three attributes: (1) awareness of (2) interpretation of, and (3) response to a patient's particular manifestations of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cultural influences on these three attributes were discussed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Considering a patient's subjective life experiences and individual cultural contexts may be important to have a more comprehensive picture of self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This concept analysis will be useful for researchers and health care providers seeking to understand the role patients' individual circumstances play within processes of self-monitoring of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "year": "2016",
    "abstract": "Chronic hepatitis C is a systemic disease inducing metabolic alterations leading to extrahepatic consequences. In particular, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection seems to increase the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in predisposed individuals, independently of liver disease stage. The mechanisms through which hepatitis C induces T2DM involve direct viral effects, insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune-mediated processes. Many studies have reported the clinical consequences of type 2 diabetes mellitus on hepatitis C outcome, but very few studies have addressed the issue of microangiopathic complications among patients with hepatitis C only, who develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, clinical trials in HCV-positive patients have reported improvement in glucose metabolism after antiviral treatment; recent studies have suggested that this metabolic amelioration might have a clinical impact on type 2 diabetes mellitus-related complications. These observations raise the question as to whether the HCV eradication may also have an impact on the future morbidity and mortality due to type 2 diabetes mellitus. The scope of this review is to summarise the current evidence linking successful antiviral treatment and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications in hepatitis C-infected patients.",

    "abstract": "A major global public health concern is the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. While still battling communicable diseases, Bangladesh is already inundated with non-communicable diseases. Type 2 diabetes has been found in almost 90.0% of all instances of diabetes. The main risk factors for type 2 diabetes are an excessively caloric diet, advanced age, sedentary behavior and obesity. Along with preexisting risk factors, many micro-nutrients have been related to a rise in the incidence of diabetes. The study's objective was to measure and contrast the zinc levels in serum between individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls. This cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2018 to June 2019 at the Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subjects were chosen using a purposeful (non-random) sample method. In total, 100 people participated in this study. They were divided into two groups: 50 individuals who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus were chosen as cases and 50 individuals who appeared to be in generally excellent health were chosen as controls. For the analytical aims of this investigation, serum zinc levels were examined. All values were expressed as the mean SD. The statistical analyses were carried out using the Windows program statistics package for social science (SPSS). The statistical significance of the difference between the case and control groups was evaluated using the Student's unpaired 't' test. A thorough research revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients had significantly lower mean serum zinc levels than healthy controls (case group was 110.96\u00b113.60 and control group 130.18\u00b19.95\u03bcg/dl). Cross-sectional research was used in this study. The current study's findings showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus patients had dramatically changed serum zinc levels.

We compared the trajectories of proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline between young-onset (aged \u226440\u2009years) and late-onset (aged >40\u2009years) type\u20092 diabetes mellitus in a Japanese multicenter cohort.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants without diabetic kidney disease were divided into two groups according to age at diagnosis: young- and late-onset. The primary endpoint was eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m, proteinuria or both. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards were calculated to estimate incidence.\nRESULTS: Among 626 participants with type\u20092 diabetes mellitus, 78 (12.4%) had young-onset and 548 (87.6%) had late-onset diabetes. The incidence of eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m was lower (16.7% vs 33.5%, P\u2009=\u20090.003), but that of proteinuria was higher (46.2% vs 28.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.002) in the young-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus group. The Kaplan-Meyer curve showed that young-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus was associated with a decreased hazard ratio (HR) for eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m and an increased HR for proteinuria compared with late-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus. In the multivariate Cox analysis, young-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus increased the HR (95% confidence interval) of proteinuria (1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.03-2.26), but did not change the eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m HR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Young-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus has a lower HR of eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73\u2009m and an increased HR of proteinuria compared with late-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus, indicating that young-onset type\u20092 diabetes mellitus has a different time course for the development of proteinuria and subsequent eGFR decline.",

Health-promoting behaviors are crucial for enhancing the quality of life in individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, the relationship between self-regulatory fatigue in type 2 diabetes, social support, and health-promoting behaviors remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the interconnections among social support, self-regulatory fatigue, and health-promoting behaviors, as well as to examine the mediating role of self-regulatory fatigue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional design was employed using the Self-Regulatory Fatigue Scale (SRF-S), the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), and the Health Promotion Scale for People with Diabetes Mellitus (T2DHPS). These scales assessed social support, self-regulatory fatigue, and health-promoting behaviors in 316 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, exploring the relationships among these variables. SPSS and AMOS were used for statistical analysis to investigate the mediating effects.\nRESULTS: Social support in type 2 diabetes mellitus positively predicted health-promoting behaviors (\u03b2 = 0.401,  < 0.001). The regression coefficients of self-regulatory fatigue in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus social support (\u03b2 = -0.502,  < 0.001), and health-promoting behaviors (\u03b2 = -0.331,  < 0.001), both exhibiting significant differences. Self-regulatory fatigue mediated the relationship between social support and health-promoting behaviors in these patients, with a mediation effect of 0.166, consisting of 29.28% of the total effect.\nCONCLUSION: A significant interplay exists among social support, self-regulatory fatigue, and health-promoting behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The findings suggest that self-regulatory fatigue mediates the relationship between social support and health-promoting behaviors. Healthcare professionals should focus on enhancing patients' social support to mitigate self-regulatory fatigue and improve health behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common chronic metabolic age-associated disease. Elderly patients over 65 years of age predominate among those with type 2 diabetes. 70% of patients with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. The article presents data on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes in the Russian Federation. It also reflects information about the impact of lifestyle and aging on the progression of carbohydrate metabolism disorders. The paper presents studies that prove the possibility of preventing the transition of prediabetes to diabetes. Various methods of preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus, including lifestyle changes, medications, and metabolic surgery in patients with prediabetes, are being considered. Particular attention is paid to the effectiveness and possibility of using these methods of prevention in the elderly in general.",

    "title": "Genomic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus among Filipinos.",
    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus leads to debilitating complications that affect the quality of life of many Filipinos. Genetic variability contributes to 30% to 70% of T2DM risk. Determining genomic variants related to type 2 diabetes mellitus susceptibility can lead to early detection to prevent complications. However, interethnic variability in risk and genetic susceptibility exists. This study aimed to identify variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus among Filipinos using a case-control design frequency matched for age and sex. A comparison was made between 66 unrelated Filipino adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 121 without. Genotyping was done using a candidate gene approach on genetic variants of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications involving allelic association and genotypic association studies with correction for multiple testing. Nine (9) significant variants, mostly involved in glucose and energy metabolism, associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Filipinos were found. Notably, a CDKAL1 variant (rs7766070) confers the highest level of risk while rs7119 (HMG20A) and rs708272 (CETP) have high risk allele frequencies in this population at 0.77 and 0.66, respectively, making them potentially good markers for type 2 diabetes mellitus screening. The data generated can be valuable in developing genetic risk prediction models for type 2 diabetes mellitus to diagnose and prevent the condition among Filipinos.",
