Tobacco smoking remains the predominant risk factor for lung cancer development. Nontobacco risk factors include environmental and occupational exposures, chronic lung disease, lung infections, and lifestyle factors. Because tobacco remains the leading risk factor for lung cancer, disease prevention is focused on smoking avoidance and cessation. Other prevention measures include healthy diet choices and maintaining a physically active lifestyle. Future work should focus on smoking cessation campaigns and better understanding disease development and treatment strategies in nonsmokers.",

One of the reasons lung cancer is at the top of the list is that it is often not diagnosed until the cancer is at an advanced stage. Thus, the earliest diagnosis of lung cancer is crucial, especially in screening high-risk populations, such as smokers, exposure to fumes, oil fields, toxic occupational places, etc. Based on the current knowledge, it looks that there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers. The current diagnosis of lung cancer includes different types of imaging complemented with pathological assessment of biopsies, but these techniques can still not detect early lung cancer developments. In this review, we described the advantages and disadvantages of current methods used in diagnosing lung cancer, and we provide an analysis of the potential use of body fluids as carriers of biomarkers as predictors of cancer development and progression.",

Despite constant progress in diagnosis and therapy, survival rates of patients diagnosed with lung cancer remain unsatisfactory. Numerous epidemiological and experimental studies conducted as early as the 1970s confirm that the most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer is long-term smoking, which remains valid to this day. In the paper, the authors present the latest data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment and molecular aspects of this cancer. In the last decade, many molecular alterations that are effective in the development of lung cancer have been discovered. In adenocarcinoma, tyrosine kinase inhibitors were developed for EGFR mutations and ALK and ROS1 translocations and were approved for use in the treatment of advanced stage adenocarcinomas. In the case of squamous cell carcinoma, the evaluation of these mutations is not yet being used in clinical practice. In addition, there are ongoing studies concerning many potential therapeutic molecular targets, such as ROS, MET, FGFR, DDR-2 and RET. Constant progress in diagnostic and therapeutic methods gives rise to hopes for an improved prognosis in patients with lung cancer.",

Diagnostic challenges are deeply related to the development of personalized therapy and molecular and precise histological characterizations of lung cancer. When addressing these features, it is very important to acknowledge the issue of tumour heterogeneity, as it imposes several questions. First of all, lung cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, at a cellular and histological level. Cellular and histological heterogeneity are addressed with emphasis on the diagnosis, pre-neoplastic lesions, and cell origin, trying to contribute to a better knowledge of carcinogenesis. Molecular intra-tumour and inter-tumour heterogeneity are also addressed as temporal heterogeneity. Lung cancer heterogeneity has implications in pathogenesis understanding, diagnosis, selection of tissue for molecular diagnosis, as well as therapeutic decision. The understanding of tumour heterogeneity is crucial and we must be aware of the implications and future developments regarding this field.",

Several distinct gene profiles were associated with lung cancer in China: high EGFR mutation rate, low KRAS mutation rate and more comorbidity of HBV infection. Thus, local Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Guidelines with more consideration of drug accessibility, regional development differences were highly recommended for clinical practice. For treatment, targeted therapy has achieved fruitful progress. Immunotherapy in China was a little bit lag behind previously and now there is a surge of immunotherapeutic drugs under investigation. For future, more preventive strategies and more trials considering chrematistics of Chinese lung cancer are needed.\nSUMMARY: There are achievements and shortcomings for lung cancer prevention and treatment in China.

Since tobacco smoking is the cause in vast majority of cases, the incidence of lung cancer is expected to rise in those countries with high or rising incidence of tobacco smoking. Even though populations at risk of developing lung cancer are easily identified, mass screening for lung cancer is not supported by currently available evidence. In the case of non-small cell lung cancer, a cure may be possible with surgical resection followed by post-operative chemotherapy in those diagnosed at an early stage. A small minority of patients who present with locally advanced disease may also benefit from pre-operative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy to down stage the tumor to render it potentially operable. In a vast majority of patients, however, lung cancer presents at an advanced stage and a cure is not possible with currently available therapeutic strategies. Similarly, small cell lung cancer confined to one hemi-thorax may be curable with a combination of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation, if complete remission is achieved at the primary site. Small cell lung cancer that is spread beyond the confines of one hemi-thorax is, however, considered incurable.

Quantitative proteomics provides the relative different protein abundance in normal and cancer patients which offers the information for molecular interactions, signaling pathways, and biomarker identification. Here we introduce both theoretical and practical applications in the use of quantitative proteomics approaches, with principles of current technologies and methodologies including gel-based, label free, stable isotope labeling as well as targeted proteomics. Predictive markers of drug resistance, candidate biomarkers for diagnosis, and prognostic markers in lung cancer have also been discovered and analyzed by quantitative proteomic analysis. Moreover, construction of protein networks enables to provide an opportunity to interpret disease pathway and improve our understanding in cancer therapeutic strategies, allowing the discovery of molecular markers and new therapeutic targets for lung cancer.",

    "title": "Gut microbial metabolites in lung cancer development and immunotherapy: Novel insights into gut-lung axis.",
    "year": "2024",
    "abstract": "Metabolic derivatives of numerous microorganisms inhabiting the human gut can participate in regulating physiological activities and immune status of the lungs through the gut-lung axis. The current well-established microbial metabolites include short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan and its derivatives, polyamines (PAs), secondary bile acids (SBAs), etc. As the study continues to deepen, the critical function of microbial metabolites in the occurrence and treatment of lung cancer has gradually been revealed. Microbial derivates can enter the circulation system to modulate the immune microenvironment of lung cancer. Mechanistically, oncometabolites damage host DNA and promote the occurrence of lung cancer, while tumor-suppresive metabolites directly affect the immune system to combat the malignant properties of cancer cells and even show considerable application potential in improving the efficacy of lung cancer immunotherapy. Considering the crosstalk along the gut-lung axis, in-depth exploration of microbial metabolites in patients' feces or serum will provide novel guidance for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment selection strategies. In addition, targeted therapeutics on microbial metabolites are expected to overcome the bottleneck of lung cancer immunotherapy and alleviate adverse reactions, including fecal microbiota transplantation, microecological preparations, metabolite synthesis and drugs targeting metabolic pathways. In summary, this review provides novel insights and explanations on the intricate interplay between gut microbial metabolites and lung cancer development, and immunotherapy through the lens of the gut-lung axis, which further confirms the possible translational potential of the microbiome metabolome in lung cancer treatment.",

In addition, lung cancer is associated with the highest mortality among all cancer types (Wu et al., Exp Ther Med 16:3004-3010, 2018). Previous studies report\u00a0that microbiota play an important role in lung cancer. Notably, changes in lung and gut microbiota, are associated with progression of lung cancer. Several studies report that lung and gut microbiome promote lung cancer initiation and development by modulating metabolic pathways, inhibiting the function of immune cells, and producing pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, some factors such as\u00a0microbiota dysbiosis, affect production of bacteriotoxins, genotoxicity and virulence effect, therefore, they play a key role in cancer progression. These findings imply that lung and gut microbiome are potential markers and targets for lung cancer. However, the role of microbiota in development and progression of lung cancer has not been fully explored.\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to systemically review recent research findings on relationship of lung and gut microbiota with lung cancer. In addition, we explored gut-lung axis and potential mechanisms of lung and gut microbiota in modulating lung cancer progression.\nCONCLUSION: Pulmonary and intestinal flora influence the occurrence, development, treatment and prognosis of lung cancer, and will provide novel strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer.",

The risk of the disease increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. The relative risk for smokers is 22.4, for very heavy smokers with a load of more than 25 packets, it can reach up to 50.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. Conventional treatments are not effective for metastatic lung cancer therapy. Although some of molecular targets have been identified with favorable response, those targets cannot be exploited due to the lack of suitable drug carriers. Lung cancer cell-derived exosomes (LCCDEs) receive recent interest in its role in carcinogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of lung cancer due to its biological functions and natural ability to carry donor cell biomolecules. LCCDEs can promote cell proliferation and metastasis, affect angiogenesis, modulate antitumor immune responses during lung cancer carcinogenesis, regulate drug resistance in lung cancer therapy, and be now considered an important component in liquid biopsy assessments for detecting lung cancer. Therapeutic deliverable exosomes are emerging as promising drug delivery agents specifically to tumor high precision medicine because of their natural intercellular communication role, excellent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, low toxicity, long blood circulation ability, biodegradable characteristics, and their ability to cross various biological barriers. Several studies are currently underway to develop novel diagnostic and prognostic modalities using LCCDEs, and to develop methods of exploiting exosomes for use as efficient drug delivery vehicles. Current status of lung cancer and extensive applicability of LCCDEs are illustrated in this review. The promising data and technologies indicate that the approach on LCCDEs implies the potential application of LCCDEs to clinical management of lung cancer patients.",

There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others.

Proteomics is a tool that can play an effective role in identifying diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for lung cancer. Cytokines are proteins that play a decisive role in activating body's immune system in lung cancer. They can increase the growth of the tumor (oncogenic cytokines) or limit tumor growth (anti-tumor cytokines) by regulating related signaling pathways such as proliferation, growth, metastasis, and apoptosis.\nAREAS COVERED: In the present study, a total of 223 papers including 196 research papers and 27 review papers, extracted from PubMed and Scopus and published from 1997 to present, are reviewed. The most important involved-cytokines in lung cancer including TNF-\u03b1, IFN- \u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, VEGF and interleukins such as IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, IL-10, IL-22, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are introduced. Also, the pathological and biological role of such cytokines in cancer signaling pathways is explained.\nEXPERT OPINION: In lung cancer, the cytokine expression changes under the physiological conditions of the immune system, and inflammatory cytokines are associated with the progression of lung cancer. Therefore, the cytokine expression profile can be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic responses, and survival of patients with lung cancer.",

In 1986 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer to become the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. The lung cancer epidemic is primarily attributable to cigarette smoking, which is responsible for at least 80% of the disease in women. There are gender differences in the distribution of lung cancer by histologic type, even controlling for smoking, and some data suggest greater female than male susceptibility to lung cancer at a given level of smoking. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking women. Family history of lung cancer, personal history of lung disease (e.g. asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis), and a history of radiotherapy also appear to be associated with increased risk. Data specific to women on the role of household radon exposures or of specific occupational or environmental exposures are relatively sparse and inconsistent. Finally, many studies have reported a decreased risk of lung cancer in individuals who consume high levels of fruits and vegetables; however, clinical trials fail to support a beneficial effect of beta-carotene supplementation. Since cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer cases in women, efforts to prevent adolescent girls from starting to smoke and to encourage cessation among established smokers have the greatest potential for reducing the female lung cancer burden.",

Risks for marijuana and hookah use, and the new e-cigarettes, are yet to be consistently defined and will be important areas for continued research as use of these products increases. Other known environmental risk factors include exposures to radon, asbestos, diesel, and ionizing radiation. Host factors have also been associated with lung cancer risk, including family history of lung cancer, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infections. Studies to identify genes associated with lung cancer susceptibility have consistently identified chromosomal regions on 15q25, 6p21 and 5p15 associated with lung cancer risk. Risk prediction models for lung cancer typically include age, sex, cigarette smoking intensity and/or duration, medical history, and occupational exposures, however there is not yet a risk prediction model currently recommended for general use.

This review will discuss the latest scientific evidence regarding the mechanisms driving lung cancer risk in HIV infection, the clinical presentation of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons and recent data regarding the outcomes, treatment and prevention of lung cancer in this group.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Increased risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected persons is primarily due to higher smoking rates, but emerging evidence also implicates immunosuppression and inflammatory processes. Lung cancer outcomes may be worse in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral era, but this may stem, in part, from treatment disparities. Early detection of lung cancer using chest computed tomography (CT) is being increasingly adopted for smokers in the general population, and recent studies suggest that it may be safe and efficacious in HIV-infected smokers.\nSUMMARY: Lung cancer is an important complication associated with chronic HIV infection. It is associated with unique HIV-related causal mechanisms, and may be associated with worse outcomes in some HIV-infected persons. Smoking cessation and early cancer detection with chest CT are likely to benefit HIV-infected smokers.",

Results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) have shown that low-dose computed tomography (CT) is capable of detecting lung neoplasms in individuals at high risk. However, whether it is advantageous to perform lung cancer screening on these patients is a significant concern, as are the potential adverse outcomes from screening.\nMETHODS: A review of several randomized clinical trials, focusing on the NLST, was undertaken. Adverse outcomes and costs related to lung cancer screening were also examined.\nRESULTS: Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT in high-risk individuals reduced lung cancer deaths by more than 20% when compared with those screened by chest radiography. False-positive results were seen in both groups, but the number of adverse events from the screening test and subsequent diagnostic procedures was low.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening is controversial, but the NLST has demonstrated that such testing may reduce lung cancer deaths in high-risk individuals when performed with low-dose CT rather than chest radiography. Guidelines should be established to not only help identify an appropriate screening population, but also develop standards for radiological testing.",

Results from major international trials, including the National Lung Screening Trial, Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek trial, and Multicenter Italian Lung Detection studies, demonstrating the efficacy of LDCT in reducing lung cancer mortality, are reviewed. The potential of liquid biopsy as a complement to LDCT is explored, with a focus on multi-cancer early detection technologies. Notable advances include the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas study and the Galleri\u00ae test, which have shown promise in detecting cancer at early stages through blood-based screening. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of current screening methods, including the need to improve strategies for screening non-smokers and the importance of balancing benefits against risks.

Lung cancer screening is an effective measure to reduce lung cancer mortality. Existing studies have shown that screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20%. Currently, lung cancer screening is recommended internationally and nationally. Studying the development status of lung cancer screening helps us to identify the high-risk groups of lung cancer, explore reasonable screening programs, improve the cost-effectiveness of screening and reduce the economic burden.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) is the seventh leading cause of death among solid tumors. The main risk factor for lung cancer is smoking; however, approximately 15% of lung cancer patients have never smoked. LCINS is more frequent in women, irrespective of geographical location, nevertheless, the highest incidence has been found in South-East Asia. The histological incidence of adenocarcinoma is higher in the group of never smokers than squamous cell carcinoma. There is a familial clustering of lung cancer that is more pronounced in never smokers, where the family history was associated with an increased risk. Genome-wide association studies identified certain chromosomal aberrations in LCINS. Furthermore, the oncogenic mutation pattern is distinct in nonsmoking patients: activating mutations of EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase are more frequent. The etiology of LCINS includes several environmental factors as well, such as environmental tobacco smoke, viral and hormonal factors, a variety of pulmonary diseases and certain occupational exposures. It is now established that EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment (erlotinib and geftinib) in lung cancer is more effective in LCINS, owing to the higher incidence of EGFR mutation in nonsmokers. Despite the growing body of information on LCINS in recent years there is a need to further investigate the pathogenesis of this particular lung cancer. Future studies on LCINS should try to tackle the issues of prevention, early diagnosis and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets to combat lung cancer disease.",

Lung cancer has no specific clinical symptoms in its early stages and lacks effective detection, making early detection difficult. The survival rate for advanced lung cancer is meager, with a median survival of only 12 months for stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with platinumbased chemotherapy. Exosomes could provide vital information for the early diagnosis of lung cancer and have the potential to become a tumor marker for lung cancer. In addition, scientists have proposed encouraging ways to treat lung cancer by loading drugs, proteins, microRNAs, and siRNAs into exosomes. Therefore, studying lung cancer exosomes and exosomal nano drugs will provide new ideas and approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. This paper reviews the progress of research on the biological functions of exosomes and exosomal nanomedicines and their applications in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the United States, with approximately 135,000 men and women dying each year. While much has been learned about the etiologic risk factors, less progress has been made in therapy. Five-year survival rates remain at less than 10%. However, there has been some progress in the therapy of one histological subtype of lung cancer, small cell lung cancer. Totaling around 20% of lung cancer cases, small cell lung cancer is distinct from the other histologic subtypes in its biologic behavior and responsiveness to therapy. In the 1960s, the median survival for patients with small cell lung cancer was approximately 3 months. With combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy median survivals now range from 1 to 2 years, and there is evidence for a curative potential since approximately 10% of patients who initially present with limited disease survive greater than 2 years. The unique clinical aspects of this histological subtype potentially relate to its underlying cell of origin. This behavior is reflected in the numerous paraneoplastic syndromes that frequently accompany small cell lung cancer. Its propensity for early dissemination have made staging the extent of disease an important part of the clinical evaluation. Since small cell lung cancer is sensitive to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy, there have been multiple clinical trials evaluating drug/radiotherapy combinations. This article will briefly describe the unique aspects of small cell lung cancer as opposed to other histological subtypes of lung cancer and give an overview of the current clinical approach and treatment of this disease.",

It is increasingly being recognized in India.\nMETHODS: We did a systematic review of the published studies on epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in India. Literature from other countries was also reviewed.\nRESULTS: With increasing prevalence of smoking, lung cancer has reached epidemic proportions in India. It has surpassed the earlier commonest form of cancer, that of oropharynx, and now is the commonest malignancy in males in many hospitals. In addition to smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, indoor air pollution and dietary factors have recently been implicated in the causation of lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is still the commonest histological type in India in contrast to the Western countries, although adenocarcinoma is becoming more common. Molecular genetics of lung cancer has opened up new vistas of research in carcinogenesis. Various modalities for early detection through screening are being investigated. Majority of the patients have locally advanced or disseminated disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery. Chemotherapy applied as an adjunct with radiation improves survival and the quality of life. New anticancer drugs, which have emerged during the last decade, have shown an improved efficacy-toxicity ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: In view of our large population, the burden of lung cancer will be quite enormous in India. Drastic measures aimed at discouraging people from smoking must be taken to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to lung cancer.",
