For people who do not have this mutation, BRAF inhibitors are not a treatment option. We found that in hairy cell leukemia, when BRAF is not mutated, the MEK gene frequently is. Binimetinib is a MEK inhibitor which targets MEK. It is important to determine if this drug can be a good treatment option in those who cannot benefit treatment with BRAF inhibitors.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if binimetinib is an effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia that does not have a BRAF mutation.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 18 and older with hairy cell leukemia without a mutation in the BRAF gene and whose disease either did not respond to treatment or came back after treatment\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Blood and urine tests\n* Lung and heart tests\n* Eye exam\n* Bone marrow biopsy: A needle will be injected through the participant s skin into the bone to remove a sample of marrow.\n* CT or MRI scan: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell leukemia comprising 2 percent of all leukemias, or approximately 1300 new cases per year in the US.\n* BRAF V600E mutation is very common in classic HCL.\n* HCL variant (HCLv) is wild type for BRAF and is more aggressive compared to classic HCL due to its lower response and shorter duration of response to standard purine analog chemotherapy. The median survival is only \\~6 years compared to \\>25 years for classic HCL.\n* CD25+ classic-appearing HCL-cells that express unmutated IGHV4-34+ immunoglobulin rearrangement, are wild-type for BRAF, and confer a poor prognosis when treated with standard purine analog chemotherapy.\n* While BRAF and MEK combination inhibition is making an impact in the treatment of BRAF V600E mutated HCL, this treatment is not applicable for patients with BRAF-WT HCL/HCLv. Furthermore, with poor survival outcomes in this patient population, lack of targeted therapy constitutes a clear unmet need.\n* Recently, several BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients have received MEK inhibitors by compassionate use and have had lifesaving partial to complete remission, however the response has not been assessed systematically in clinical trials.\n* Binimetinib (also known as MEK162) is an orally bioavailable, selective and potent mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase (MEK1 and MEK2) inhibitor, which is approved for use in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma\n* We have described MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations which may drive the aggressive clinical behavior of BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients, but MEK inhibition may be clinically useful even in these patients without known MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to binimetinib, in participants with BRAF WT HCL and HCLv.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* BRAF WT HCL or HCLv with at least 1 prior purine analog treatment\n* Need for treatment as evidenced by any one of the following: ANC \\<1 x10\\^3/mcL, Hgb \\<10g/dL, Platelet count \\<100 x10\\^3/mcL, leukemia cell count \\>5 x10\\^3/mcL, symptomatic splenomegaly, enlarging HCL mass \\> 2cm in short axis.\n* greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\n* No uncontrolled infection, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, or secondary malignancy requiring treatment.\n* No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Single arm phase 2 trial to determine ORR in participants with relapsed/refractory BRAF WT HCL and HCLv.\n* 2-phase minimax design will be used to rule out an unacceptable 10 percent in favor of an improved 25 percent ORR.\n* Initially 16 evaluable participants will be enrolled. If 2 or more achieve a major response, then accrual will continue to a total of 31 evaluable participants.\n* Binimetinib will be given at a dose of 45mg twice daily for as long as participants can continue dosing chronically without significant toxicity or a trial off therapy due to achievement of MRD negative complete remission or partial response (PR) / complete response (CR) in which they would like a trial off therapy.

    "brief_summary": "Studies have indicated that the improvement in pathological complete response (pCR) is significantly correlated with triple-negative breast cancer\uff08TNBC\uff09patients' overall survival (OS). Patients with TNBC have poor efficacy for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The combination of neoadjuvant therapy with immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been demonstrated to enhance the pCR rate of TNBC patients, increasing it from 45% to approximately 60%. Therefore, how to further improve the pCR rate of TNBC breast cancer became the main objective of this study. Stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) not only kills tumor cells directly, but also kills the distant unirradiated tumor cells by promoting the cross-initiation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells, a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect. Our research team has recently discovered that the triple therapy model of SBRT + anti-vascular targeting + anti-PD-1 was safe and efficacious in lung cancer patients. Cadonilimab (AK104) is an PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody. In order to improve the pCR, a single-arm, open, phase II clinical study was proposed to explore the safety and efficacy of SBRT+AK104+chemotherapy, a neoadjuvant treatment modality, in the treatment of TNBC.",

    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) is a multi-organ disorder characterized by immune dysregulation, impaired organ function, and decreased survival for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients.\n* The JAK-STAT pathway plays an important role in immune cell development and function, including antigen presenting cells, B- and T-cells, and its activation leads to a cascade promoting a proinflammatory cytokine milieu.\n* Pacritinib is a JAK2/IRAK1/CSF1R/FLT3 inhibitor, with an established safety and efficacy profile in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (myelofibrosis) and of acute GVHD.\n* Pacritinib s immunomodulatory effects suggest therapeutic benefit for cGVHD, without abrogating the graft-versus-leukemia effect after HSCT.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Phase I: to determine the safety of pacritinib in participants with refractory cGVHD\n* Phase II: to determine the efficacy of pacritinib in participants with refractory cGVHD\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Moderate or severe cGVHD (after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) diagnosed and staged per NIH criteria.\n* cGVHD that did not respond to at least two prior lines of systemic therapy.\n* Age \\>=18 years.\n* If participant is taking systemic therapy for cGVHD at the time of enrollment, they must be on stable or tapering doses in the preceding 4 weeks.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This Phase I/II study will use a modified 3+3 dose-escalation design, with two planned dose levels of pacritinib, followed by a small efficacy evaluation in a randomized phase II design.\n* Pacritinib will be given taken orally once or twice daily (based on dose level) on days 1- 28 of a 28-day cycle.\n* Pacritinib treatment will continue for up to 12 months. cGVHD response will be evaluated at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from the start of pacritinib. All participants will be followed through 2 years post-initiation of pacritinib.\n* The accrual ceiling set at 50 participants.",

    "brief_summary": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of most prevalent malignant tumors in the world. According to the 2020 edition of the global cancer statistics report, the incidence rate of BC has overtaken lung cancer to become the most commonly diagnosed cancer.\n\nIn the past three decades, survival of patients with primary BC have been notably improved, mainly due to early detection of the disease and advances in adjuvant treatments such as endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and anti-HER2 therapy. Patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative primary BC account for approximately 70% of all cases of early breast cancer. Endocrine therapy is the core treatment for this subtype of BC. Tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitor or their sequential administration can reduce the recurrence and mortality of this BC subtype.\n\nThe results of TEXT/SOFT study showed that, compared with the traditional 5-year tamoxifen treatment, tamoxifen + OFS or aromatase inhibitor + OFS can further improve the survival of HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. However, for premenopausal BC patients with HR+/HER2-, only 82.5% (tamoxifen plus OFS) and 85.7% (aromatase inhibitor plus OFS) of 5-year DFS were achieved. For postmenopausal BC patients, the 5-year DFS was only about 84% with aromatase inhibitors. Therefore, the survival of HR+/ HER2- BC patients needs to be further improved.\n\nMetronomic chemotherapy refers to the use of the minimum effective dose of chemotherapy drugs for long-term, uninterrupted administration to achieve anti-tumor effect. Metronomic chemotherapy has gradually been verified in clinical practice in the past 20 years. In 2020, SYSUCC-001 study has confirmed that capecitabine (650 mg/ m2 bid, for 1 years) can reduce the risk of 5-year DFS events by 36% in TNBC patients in addition to standard treatment. Besides, POTENT study has confirmed that the combination of endocrine therapy and S-1 (for one year) can further reduce the risk of iDFS by 37% in HR+/HER2- BC patients who have completed the standard treatment.\n\nCompared with capecitabine, S-1 has no indication for BC and it is not in the recommendation for BC treatment in the guidelines. Therefore, the investigators conduct this study to explore whether adjuvant Capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy for one year can further improve the survival of BC patients with HR+/ HER2- in addition to standard treatment.",
    "detailed_description": "In order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of capecitabine combined with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative women with breast cancer, our center launched a multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III clinical trial of capecitabine combined with endocrine therapy in the adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative women with breast cancer. Select suitable patients for inclusion based on the inclusion criteria. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group and control group in a 1:1 ratio. The experimental group received 1 year of capecitabine (500mg Tid orally)+standard endocrine therapy (at least 5 years); The control group received 1 year of placebo (Tid oral)+standard endocrine therapy (at least 5 years). If an intolerable toxic reaction occurs, adjust the drug dosage according to the CTCAE 4.0 principles for managing adverse drug reactions, but still cannot tolerate it, stop chemotherapy. The primary end point of efficacy evaluation of iDFS included detection of local recurrence, distant recurrence, ipsilateral and contralateral invasive breast cancer, the second primary invasive non breast cancer, and death. During the first 24 months (30 days per month, the same below) after random grouping, clinical recurrence event assessments will be conducted every 3 months (\u00b1 2 weeks). Subsequently, an evaluation will be conducted every 6 months (\u00b1 3 weeks).Clinical suspected recurrence will be determined through additional imaging examinations, and should be determined as much as possible through histology/cytology (unless deemed unsafe based on the researcher's judgment).Survival assessment will continue until 60 months after randomization of the last patient, death, withdrawal from informed consent, loss to follow-up, or end of the study, depending on which situation occurs first. Survival information can be obtained through clinical visits, phone calls, or other means.",

    "brief_summary": "Lung cancer is the most common primary cancer of the lung and is responsible for the ever increasing number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Especially in China, the burden of lung cancer has been rising rapidly due to its large and growing population. Histologically, approximately 85% of lung cancers are non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular targeted therapy has been shown to dramatically improve the quality of life and survival outcomes of NSCLC patients. One of the most important targeted drugs in NSCLC has been the epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), while there exists some other rare targetable mutation in NSCLC. Emerging evidence underlines that, rather than a single point mutation, some rare mutations present with a wide array of mutations, essentially in NSCLC.\n\nDifferent rare mutations with NSCLC have divergent clinical and therapeutic implications with a particular distinction. Therefore, there is an unmet need for more effective therapies for NSCLC with rare mutations. In summary, identification of genetic alterations in NSCLC with rare mutations is increasingly essential to perform molecular diagnostics and individualized treatments. This project aims to create a registry of patients with NSCLC with rare mutations to further the characterization of molecular alterations and develop (novel) treatments based on the detection.",

Targetable driver mutations in NSCLC are more prevalent in Asian population compared to those in Western population, which offers chances to apply suitable targeted therapies worldwide. For patients who failed to the treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the genetic mutations from next-generation sequencing (NGS) reports can serve as the reference of treatment selection. Moreover, the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 serves as a helpful indicator for the response of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). On the other hand, patients with wild-type EGFR/ALK mutations and PD-L1-negative NSCLC who received chemotherapy had relative poorer survival than those received suitable targeted therapies and ICIs. To further elucidate the underlying molecular genomic aberrations, as well as the clinical demographics and therapeutic outcomes in above subpopulations, it is necessary to have a national, multi-centers and population-focused research project to collect data completely. Tumor tissue will be collected from advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR/ALK or with EGFR/ALK mutation after resistant to TKIs for next-generation sequencing analysis in a platform of data storage and sharing.

In Denmark, the incidence of HCC is 5.2 per 100.000 population per year with a dismal prognosis as the median survival time is just 7.7 months.\n\nExtrahepatic spread of HCC is common at advanced stages with haematogenous spread to lungs, bones and adrenal glands or lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes.\n\nThe majority of patients who develop HCC have cirrhosis of the liver and in these patients, diagnosis can be made non-invasively with characteristic contrast-enhancement pattern on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are considered equal in current guidelines, MRI may have a better sensitivity especially for small lesions.\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique based on the injection of a very small dose of a tracer substance labelled with a positron emitting radioisotope. PET with the glucose tracer 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is an important tool in the staging of many cancer forms, but it is not included in the international guidelines for management of HCC because of suboptimal sensitivity of only up to 50-60 % for HCC situated in the liver.\n\nIn Aarhus, the liver specific tracer 18F-FDGal has been developed. It is a fluorine-18 labelled galactose analogue which in the human body is trapped in hepatocytes by phosphorylation by galactokinase. The first study of the diagnostic use of 18F-FDGal PET/CT in patients suspected of having HCC was published in 2011. The study showed good clinical potential for 18F-FDGal as a tracer for detection of intra- as well as extrahepatic HCC.\n\nThe aim of the present project is to establish the clinical impact and utilization of 18F-FDGal PET/CT and PET/MRI in patients suspected of having HCC or diagnosed with HCC, for staging and evaluation of treatment response including effect of treatment on liver function.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nI. Adding 18F-FDGal PET/CT or PET/MRI to diagnostic work-up of patients suspected of or diagnosed with HCC will add to the establishment of a definitive diagnosis and improve staging and thus choice of treatment.\n\nII. The uptake pattern of 18F-FDGal in HCC provides prognostic information and can be used to evaluate regional metabolic liver function before and after loco-regional treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a modern RT technique that delivers high doses of radiation to small tumor targets using highly conformal techniques, while trying to avoid healthy tissues and organs. However, SABR treatment requires increased planning, treatment time, cost and potential for higher toxicity due to the higher dose. The purpose of this study is to compare single fraction (SF) SABR vs. multiple fraction (MF) SABR in regards to toxicities, progression-free survival, quality of life (QoL), and cost-effectiveness. In a subset of patients, we will also compare patient QoL, hospitalization rates, and cost-effectiveness between patients who complete QoL questionnaires, record symptoms and receive healthcare provider-guided intervention vs. patients who complete QoL questionnaires only.",
    "detailed_description": "Radiation can be delivered in multiple fractions, or doses, and can take up to several weeks or months of treatment depending on the type of cancer. Radiation can also be offered in a single fraction. Both techniques have evidence for use in clinical care. Multiple fraction is offered to reduce the amount of radiation given at a single time that could reduce late toxicities. However, single fraction radiotherapy is more cost-effective and saves patient time. With this trial, we will compare single fraction vs. multiple fraction in regards to their impact on toxicity, progression-free survival: time from randomization to disease progression at any site or death, lesional control rate: lesion size post-SABR, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.\n\nIn a subset of sites, we will also investigate the impact of healthcare-provider guided intervention on quality of life. Questionnaires capture various symptoms such as pain, fatigue and information relating to physical, social, and mental wellbeing. This information can help shed light on patient experience and provide a better understanding of the effects of radiation therapy. In this trial, we will compare quality of life questionnaire completion, symptom reporting and healthcare-provider guided intervention vs. quality of life questionnaire completion alone, in regards to patient quality of life. Hospitalization rates and frequency of emergency department visits will also be investigated.\n\nSample size: The total sample size of 598 for this trial was calculated based on the primary endpoint of toxicity for the single vs. multiple fraction SABR randomization. Calculations were performed based on the results of the SABR-5 trial and our clinical judgement.\n\nQuality Assurance: Radiation treatments are based on the current phase III SABR-COMET-3 trial and as per recent clinical evidence. All treatments will be planned as per protocol including computed tomography (CT) simulation, organs at risk contouring and undergo a quality assurance process.\n\nFor the subset of sites involved in the second randomization, training will be provided to patients on the use of Noona, a patient-reported outcome platform.",

    "detailed_description": "Malignant tumors are a major public health problem affecting global health. According to Globocan data, in 2020, there will be about 19.3 million new cases of malignant tumors and 9.9 million deaths worldwide. In China, there will be about 1.56 million new cases and 910,000 deaths, ranking first in the world. The global burden of disease is dominated by the burden of cancer, which will continue to increase globally for at least the next 20 years. However, in the early stages, most cancers are largely asymptomatic or have only a few nonspecific symptoms, including fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in stool characteristics, cough, etc., which are often overlooked, and therefore, exploring new strategies for the early and accurate diagnosis of malignant tumors has a crucial role to play in improving the prognosis of patients. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is expressed at low levels in healthy mesothelial tissues (pleura, peritoneum, pericardium) but appears to be highly expressed in many cancer cells, especially in cancers characterized by invasiveness and poor prognosis, including pancreatic, ovarian, and lung adenocarcinomas. Preclinical studies have shown that MSLN expression has a positive role in malignant transformation and chemoresistance through the Wnt/NF-\u03baB/ERK1/2/Akt signaling pathway. Abnormal expression of MSLN plays an important role in tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis. Meanwhile, MSLN overexpression can activate the PI3K pathway and induce drug resistance in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, MSLN has become a popular target for targeted antitumor therapy due to its high differential expression, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug combinations (ADCs), radioimmunotherapy (RIT), and CAR-T cellular immunotherapy for mesothelioma. Several antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) against MSLN have been developed, such as LMB-100 (also known as RG7787) as an antibody-drug coupling targeting MSLN, which has been effective in terms of efficacy.Haas et al. utilized lentiviral transduction of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified autologous T-cells to target anti-MSLN in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer patients, and the results proved to be safe and feasible. Therefore, MSLN is an important target for precise diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.\n\nCurrently, high-quality, accurate imaging, multiphase computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used for detection, staging, and treatment planning. However, CT and MRI scans frequently detect lesions that cannot be further defined, and enhanced CT and enhanced MR also remain limited to morphological features of the tumor. This leads to uncertainty in the diagnosis or extent of disease. For example, overlapping imaging of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and chronic pancreatitis has led to an indistinguishable misdiagnosis rate of up to 25%. Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and cholangiography may provide additional evidence of inflammatory etiology rather than malignancy, these methods are invasive, carry the risk of tumor dissemination along the needle tracks, and may also have a false-negative rate of up to 60%. FDG is a nonspecific tumor imaging agent. Because the energy metabolism of lymphocytes, monocytes, and other inflammatory cells during phagocytosis is also dominated by anaerobic glycolysis, proliferative lesions such as infections and granulomas, and nonmalignant lesions such as benign tumors, may also show high uptake of \\[18F\\]FDG. False-positive PET/CT cases are mainly inflammatory lesions of the pancreas (autoimmune pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis), and granulomatous lesions (pancreatic tuberculosis). Compared with the conventional imaging agent \\[18F\\]FDG. 68Ga-labeled Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) inhibitors have higher uptake in tumor and lower uptake in other normal tissues, resulting in a higher Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR), which is conducive to improving their sensitivity in detecting tumor. However, 68Ga-FAPI-04 is not a tumor-specific imaging agent, and fibrosis caused by some other benign lesions may also lead to increased FAP expression. Xiaoli Lan, Kirienko M et al. showed that FAP is also expressed in pancreatic \u03b1-cells, which is another important factor limiting the use of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. With the growth of MSLN-targeted therapies in the field of oncology, the development of MSLN-targeted PET imaging strategies as companion diagnostics will hopefully optimize MSLN-targeted therapies. Lamberts LE et al. used 89Zr-MMOT0530A PET to visualize pancreatic and ovarian cancer lesions and antibody biodistribution, a technique that could potentially guide personalized antibody-based therapy. Linda N. Broer's study revealed the potential of 89Zr-MSLN PET to respond to MSLN expression and 227Th-MSLN tumor uptake and biodistribution, demonstrating the potential of 89Zr-MSLN PET as a tool for predicting 227Th-MSLN antitumor activity. Hou's study revealed that the 124I-anti-MSLN probe demonstrated a rapid metabolic rate and the ability to specifically identify MSLN-positive tumors in vivo.\n\nTo sum up, this project carries out integrated PET/MR or PET/CT visualization of patients with clinically suspected or diagnosed pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and other malignant tumors with high expression of MSLN and healthy volunteers, using targeted MSLN-specific imaging agents (\\[68Ga\\]Ga-NOTA-MSLN antibody fragment for example), with a view to achieving the following purposes: (1) Patients with malignant tumors: for diagnosis and staging of diseases, comparing with the gold standard pathological diagnosis, assessing diagnostic efficacy, clarifying the presence or absence of lesions, and judging the location and nature of lesions; comparing with \\[18F\\]FDG PET for accurate staging, evaluating the tumor load, and helping to determine the treatment plan.

    "brief_summary": "Despite enormous advances in thoracic surgery and oncology, two critical issues concern patients undergoing curative-intent surgery for lung, gastric and esophageal cancer: first, a majority (\\~60%) of patients experience minor and major adverse events occurring during and in the days following surgery; second, patients worry about the significant risk of cancer recurrence and mortality months to years after surgery. These issues, combined with side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, have detrimental effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). On a deeper level, there is the problem of an ongoing failure to integrate and evaluate the best of what complementary medicine has to offer surgical oncology care. Too many clinical trials focus on single agent therapies, rather than broad multi-faceted individualized and integrative care interventions that are used in real world settings.\n\nThe Thoracic POISE project has the overarching goal of improving care for thoracic cancer patients by impacting HRQoL, reducing surgical adverse events, prolonging overall survival and pioneering integrative care delivery.",

After measuring baseline cigarette smoking rate, participants will be randomized to ECIGS or ONPS and be instructed to switch (versus smoking cigarettes) over a 6-week period.

    "detailed_description": "E-cigarettes (ECIGS), and oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), expose users to few of the chemicals found in cigarette smoke and are thus promising noncombustible harm reduction tools for smokers who would not otherwise quit smoking. For their harm reduction potential to be realized, fundamental questions must be answered. One, can persistent smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to either ECIGS or ONPS? Two, what factors influence switching? Three, does one of these noncombustible alternatives expose users to lower levels of harmful chemicals than the other? The proposed research will fill these gaps in the evidence base by randomizing 200 persistent cigarette smokers to a six-week regimen of ECIGS or ONPS. Baseline smoking rate will be established during days 1-5. After biochemically confirmed overnight smoking abstinence, laboratory visits on days 6 and 7 will assess ECIG and ONP-associated subjective reward and the reinforcing value of either ECIGS or ONPS relative to combustible cigarettes. Participants will switch from cigarette smoking to ECIGS or ONPS for the following six weeks. The primary outcome measure is the longitudinal daily count of cigarettes from baseline to the end of the six-week switch period, measured via a validated collection protocol with cigarettes per day (cpd) at a 6-month follow-up as a secondary endpoint. Changes in biomarkers of potential harm, assessed at baseline and the end of the six-week switch phase, will be secondary outcome measures.",

    "detailed_description": "Malignant tumors are a significant disease that threatens human health and life, with high incidence and mortality rates. Molecular imaging plays an important role in the early diagnosis, staging, prognosis evaluation, and therapeutic efficacy assessment of major diseases such as tumors. Currently, 18F-FDG PET imaging is the most widely used molecular imaging, but there are still problems such as physiological uptake, false negatives, and false positives. It is urgent to explore and develop a new type of tumor-targeting PET imaging.\n\nIntegrins are key members of the cell adhesion molecular family and play a central role in regulating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They are highly expressed in a variety of malignant tumors and plays a vital role in the angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of tumors, and the regulation of immune microenvironment. As such, integrins have emerged as potential targets for tumor-specific imaging. To date, PET tracers targeting integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 have been extensively studied for imaging tumor neovascularization. However, this integrin subtype also shows certain expression in normal tissue endothelial cells, posing a challenge to its clinical value as a specific marker for tumor imaging. In contrast, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26, another subtype of integrin known as \"cancer integrin\", is specifically expressed in epithelial-derived tumor cells, whereas it hardly expressed in human healthy tissues. Therefore, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 has gained attention as an attractive and promising biomarker.\n\nIn the past decade, some integrin \u03b1v\u03b26-targeting PET tracers have been synthesized, but these agents have shown relatively low affinity and specificity, with high nonspecific uptake in the gastrointestinal tract, which hinders their clinical translation. Recently, Quigley et al. introduced a novel \u03b1v\u03b26-targeted trimeric probe based on a cyclic peptide c\\[YRGDLAYp(NMe)K\\], named 68Ga-Trivehexin. This probe demonstrated favorable characteristics, including excellent targeting affinity (IC50 = 0.047 nM), enhanced tumor uptake, and longer retention time in preclinical study. The preliminary results from PET imaging in 4 cancer patients further demonstrated intense 68Ga-Trivehexin accumulation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, parotid adenocarcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; moreover, there was almost no physiological uptake in normal tissues and organs, such as stomach, intestine, liver, and lung, except for kidney (the excretory organ), resulting in an excellent tumor-to-background ratio.\n\nThe safety and metabolic stability of 68Ga-Trivehexin targeting integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 are currently supported by clinical data, and this project will further expand its application in various malignant tumors, clarify its diagnostic and staging value in different types of tumors, and qualitative and quantitative characteristics. This project is expected to provide a new and precise evaluation method for malignant tumors to compensate for the shortcomings of current imaging methods.",

These rare changes occur in genes such as but not limited to ALK, EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and NTRK which have targeted drugs in a family known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and KRAS G12C mutation, which now has a targeted inhibitor drug therapy for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goals for the study are to compare the natural history of such cancers and the treatment outcomes, including toxicities and patient-reported outcomes, for the different therapies.",

To determine the incidence, time to development, prevalence, and outcomes of patients with specific patterns of spread, such as brain metastases compared to those without, by different therapies and by molecular alterations.\n4. To better understand real-world treatment patterns of rare molecular alterations in the Canadian context, across geographic or other factors, and how treatment patterns evolve over time and as new therapies become available, how patients are investigated and how targeted and other biomarkers are used as part of clinical practice in these patients.\n5. To assess quality of life in patients with rare molecular alterations across different stages, lines and types of therapy.\n6. To perform exploratory health economic evaluations focused on the costs and benefits of managing patients with rare molecular alterations.\n7.

    "brief_summary": "Individuals attending the hospital to undergo operations are at risk of developing blood clots in the legs, known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A clot in the leg can cause swelling, pain, and other long-term problems. If a clot in the leg breaks off and travels to the lungs, it can cause problems with the lungs' ability to move oxygen from the air into the blood and may be life-threatening. This is known as pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE are known collectively as venous thromboembolism or VTE.\n\nThe importance of preventing VTE in surgical patients is widely recognised, with two main strategies used: thinning the blood with regular injections and/or tablets and wearing elastic stockings to help stop blood from sitting in the leg veins where it can clot.\n\nEvidence for using elastic stockings to prevent VTE has recently been challenged. Additionally, there is a lack of evidence for the additional benefit of stockings over and above that of blood thinning medications. If stockings were to reduce VTE over and above blood thinning medication, these benefits need to be weighed against the risks and disadvantages of stockings, including discomfort, restricting blood flow to the leg causing blisters and wounds in addition to the cost. If stockings were found not to reduce the risk of clots, they would no longer need to be used in these patients, thus reducing the disadvantages of stockings, and saving the NHS millions of pounds per year.\n\nCertain types of operations (300,000 per year in the UK) are linked with a particularly high risk of VTE, including cancer surgery, surgery in the abdomen and pelvis, and bone (orthopaedic) surgery. In these cases, patients are offered blood thinning medications both during their hospital stay and for a period after they have left the hospital. Furthermore, these patients are offered stockings to wear while in the hospital.\n\nIt is not known if, in patients who receive blood thinning medications both in hospital and after discharge, the addition of wearing stockings whilst in hospital reduces their risk of VTE any further.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate if it is worthwhile using stockings, in addition to blood thinning medication, to reduce blood clots after surgery. People enrolled in the study will be those at the highest risk of VTE and require an extended period of medication to reduce the risk of a blood clot.\n\nA computer will randomly choose one of the below treatments by chance to make the trial fair:\n\nA) Extended duration clot-reducing medicine in addition to stockings B) Extended duration clot-reducing medicine alone\n\nThe surgery and all the other medical care will continue as normal. Everyone in the study will get an ultrasound scan at 21 - 35 days after their operation to check if they have developed a blood clot. This is an additional scan, not routinely performed in the NHS, to make sure that all blood clots are detected at an early stage. Participants will receive a phone call at 7, 21-35 and 90 days after their treatment to see if they have developed a blood clot or had any problems with the treatment.",
    "detailed_description": "Research question: Is it beneficial to provide graduated compression stockings (GCS) in addition to extended duration pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (EDPTP) for surgical patients at highest risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE)? Background: Hospital-acquired thrombosis (HAT) is defined as any VTE within 90 days of hospital admission, encompassing both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). HAT represents a significant cause of preventable mortality, with over 12,000 people dying each year from hospital-associated VTE in the UK, 10-fold higher than the number dying from road traffic accidents.\n\nPrevious studies report that the risk of untreated high-risk surgical patients developing HAT is as high as 40-60% in orthopaedic patients and 15-40% in general surgery patients. For these patients at highest risk of VTE, key prevention strategies include extended pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (EDPTP) prescribed beyond hospital discharge and provision of graduated compression stockings (GCS). There is compelling evidence to support the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, however, there is little evidence to support the use of additional GCS alongside causing complications in as many as 5% of patients. The cost of providing GCS equates to a minimum of \u00a331.05 per patient episode, with as many as 270,000 relevant procedures conferring a high-risk of VTE, it could be costing the NHS \u00a38.3 million per annum.\n\nAims and objectives: The GRACE trial aims to establish whether:-\n\n1. patients undergoing surgical procedures requiring EDPTP benefit from additional GCS to prevent VTE\n2. patients receiving GCS experience an increased rate of adverse events\n\nMethods: Assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial with a non-inferiority comparison. 8,608 participants will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to one of two thromboprophylaxis strategies:\n\n1.

TK receptor activation initiates cell signaling cascades and carcinogenesis. Asbestos, thus, induces the generation of an inflammatory immunosuppressive microenvironment that may support tumor growth in individuals with genetic predisposition (2). Consequently, the lack of actionable tumor targets together with the heterogeneous stroma, support the failure of modern drugs, both TK and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (TKIs, ICIs). In this complex context, the role of germline changes in MPM remains largely unexplored, except for changes in the BAP1 gene which are known to predispose to the disease (3).\n\nThe main goal of the study is to look for germline changes of a panel of genes involved in microenvironment infiltration modulation, drug response and cancer predisposition. The study will be performed in parallel on blood samples obtained from asbestos-exposed subjects and on MPM patients. This approach will allow: detection of putative germline signatures associated with MPM onset predisposition (or even protection) with prognostic and predictive implications.\n\nThe genetic characterization of MPM has not been fully clarified until now due to the significant inter-patient variability and to the scarcely reported somatic aberrations. Most of genetic alterations in MPM are loss of function of tumor suppressor genes or caretaker genes. Thus, the present project aimed at deeply investigate the germline variation in MPM and exposed population to determine host factors involved in MPM promotion. Pathogenic germline variants in MPM are often involved in DNA damage repair and chromatin remodeling pathways, and the most frequently identified germline mutations are in BAP1 which encodes for a tumor suppressor gene. Its protein is a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme that plays an important role in chromatin modulation, transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation, DNA repair, cell death, and glucidic metabolism.\n\nBased on systematic literature review performed to identify all relevant data, a set of 30 genes involved in microenvironment infiltration modulation (e.g. RBL1), drug response (e.g. XRCC1) and cancer predisposition (e.g. BRAC1-2) has been defined. This phase will encompass a first step focused on deep mutational screening aimed at analyzing a custom panel of genes involved in microenvironment immune-inflammatory on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived DNA. A next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach will be applied by Illumina-iSeq 100 Sequencing System. From each subject enrolled in this study, total DNA will be extracted by automated purification system, then 20 ng of input DNA will be used for library construction and next generation sequencing of all coding exons from cancer related gene. The identified variants will be submitted to bioinformatics analysis by PolyPhen-2, SIFT and Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), to assess the possible impact of the corresponding amino acid substitution on the structure and function of the encoded protein. In addition, clinically significant variants will be annotated by using ClinVar-NCBI, GnomAD and COSMIC databases. Recent clinical studies have associated high tumor mutational burden (TMB) with improved patient response rates and survival benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors; hence, TMB is emerging as a biomarker of response for these immunotherapy agents. Moreover, it has been shown that germline variants can influence the molecular phenotypes of tumors and thus predict the checkpoint inhibitors efficacy. Staring from these considerations, in this study we will also analyze the germline tumor mutational burden (gTMB) by assessing the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in each selected gene.",
    "detailed_description": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm of the pleural mesothelium, mainly associated to asbestos exposure, still lacking effective therapies. Incidence rates in Europe are projected to peak around 2025, due to the long latency between exposure and disease onset. Asbestos industrial use was at its peak in the 1970s and ceased in Italy in 1994 (L.D. 257). However, in the Pavia province, reclamation of the cement plant in Broni town started in 2007: the works are not yet completed, and exposure of the population continues today. The network of ASST Pavia province and IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation identified more than 80 incident cases in the last 2 years. Therefore, we have drawn our attention to a rare cancer, with a low life expectancy (12-15 months from diagnosis). Other diseases, even with same embryologic origin from mesoderm, such as ovarian cancers, are more common, well studied and have more established therapies. We also feel the need to respond to the specific welfare and unmet needs of our territory. Inhaled asbestos fibers migrate to the pleura, where they persist, cause irritation, perpetuate tissue damage and can be found post-mortem (1).\n\nAsbestos is a not-mutagenic agent: its nanosized fibres directly interact with tyrosine kinases (TKs) (e.g. EGFR) and may induce inappropriate receptor dimerization and activation, in absence of activating somatic mutations. TK receptor activation initiates cell signaling cascades and carcinogenesis. Asbestos, thus, induces the generation of an inflammatory immunosuppressive microenvironment that may support tumor growth in individuals with genetic predisposition (2).

In this complex context, the role of germline changes in MPM remains largely unexplored, except for changes in the BAP1 gene which are known to predispose to the disease (3).\n\nWe will focus on a panel of genes involved in inflammatory infiltration, drug response, cancer predisposition to define germline signatures with potential prognostic and predictive implications. This study will contribute to decipher a still unexplored milieu and improve mechanistic knowledge on MPM biology and interindividual susceptibility to asbestos. Moreover, it could be of help in identifying novel actionable targets and in designing personalized and more efficient therapeutic strategies.\n\nThe main goal of the study is to look for germline changes of a panel of genes involved in microenvironment infiltration modulation, drug response and cancer predisposition. The study will be performed in parallel on blood samples obtained from asbestos-exposed subjects and on MPM patients. This approach will allow: i) detection of putative germline signatures associated with MPM onset predisposition (or even protection) with prognostic and predictive implications.\n\nPrimary aim will be the comparison of prevalence of germline mutations in MPM patients vs asbestos exposed healthy subjects.\n\nSecondary aim will be the comparison of overall survival (OS) according to mutational status in MPM patients.\n\nThe study will be structured on three phases. The first step will regard sample collection. Patients affected by MPM, followed in the Pneumology Unit will be candidate to the study (30 cases/year).\n\nFor each of them a 4mL whole blood will be collected by blood draw (using EDTA as anticoagulant). Comparable quantity of blood will be derived from the biobank already viable at ICS Maugeri obtained from MPM patients (50 cases) and asbestos exposed subjects (30 cases). The oncological biobanks service unit is located at research laboratories of ICS Maugeri. It was funded in 2009 aimed at the collection, conservation, storage, and distribution of human biological material for research purposes. In the Maugeri institutional oncological biobank, biological samples from patients suffering from different types of cancer have been stored to date (4% malignant pleural mesothelioma) and for which clinical history and follow-up are well documented. For each enrolled case, clinical and demographic data will be collected by the PI after obtained a written informed consent. MPM patients will be treated according to international guidelines and managed based on the Interdisciplinary Group for Thoracic Neoplasms (GINT) evaluation.\n\nThe next step of the project encompasses a comprehensive and in-depth discovery effort aimed at identifying germline variations affecting a panel of genes involved in microenvironmental infiltrate regulation, drug response, and cancer susceptibility. Characterization of tumors utilizing next-generation sequencing methods is currently at the forefront of the field of personalized medicine. It should be underlined that in most cancer types, the genetic asset should be defined as a landscape consisting of a small number of mountains (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of hills, namely those genes altered infrequently. Published studies have revealed about 140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or drive tumorigenesis; other mutations are passengers and do not confer elective growth advantage. On the other hand, several genes are known to predispose to cancer when inherited in mutant form in the germ line and are not somatically mutated in cancer to a substantial degree. These genes do not confer a significant selective growth advantage when changed but can promote tumorigenesis in indirect ways. The genetic characterization of MPM has not been fully clarified until now due to the significant inter-patient variability and to the scarcely reported somatic aberrations. Most of genetic alterations in MPM are loss of function of tumor suppressor genes or caretaker genes. In absence of a context of oncogenic addiction, pharmaceutical targeting of activated transducers (mTor inhibitors, FAK inhibitors) might hold a key to improve MPM therapy. Thus, the present project aimed at deeply investigate the germline variation in MPM and exposed population to determine host factors involved in MPM promotion. Pathogenic germline variants in MPM are often involved in DNA damage repair and chromatin remodeling pathways, and the most frequently identified germline mutations are in BAP1 which encodes for a tumor suppressor gene.

This study aims to optimize the postoperative pain management of an anatomically minimally invasive lung resection (RATS) by comparing 2 pain-relieving techniques. As standard, an intercostal block is placed at the end of the procedure by injecting a local anesthetic at the site where the patient will be operated on. This study compares the previous method with the use of cryotherapy as an intercostal block. This technique uses cryo probes and blocks postoperative pain for 1-3 months. By comparing both techniques, it is examined whether cryotherapy requires less pain medication and is therefore more effective.",
    "detailed_description": "Adequate pain control after robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) for lung resection is important to improve postoperative mobilisation and recovery, and to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications.\n\nThoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the usual care for postoperative pain management following thoracic surgery. Although the analgesic effect of TEA is clear, failure rates are 9-30% \\[1, 2, 3\\] and awake placement is stressful for patients. In addition, TEA is associated with patient immobilisation, bladder dysfunction and hypotension \\[4\\]. Based on the best available evidence and the recent guidelines by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) society, the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) includes early mobilisation after surgery as one of their key recommendations \\[5\\]. The department of Thoracic Surgery of the Antwerp University Hospital (UZA) has developed its own ERAS protocol for minimal-invasive lung surgery. The standard technique for this protocol is single-shot intercostal nerve blockade (ICNB) with ropivacaine.\n\nThis study wants to evaluate single-shot ICNB with ropivacaine versus ICNB with cryotherapy. Single-shot peripheral nerve blockade has a risk for increased need for opioids and less patient satisfaction compared to a continuous infusion technique, especially when using a multi-port robotic technique \\[6\\]. On the other hand, the technique is good in the majority of cases, easy to perform, low costs compared to the standard TEA care \\[7\\] and there is a lower incidence of adverse events \\[8\\]. Unilateral regional techniques are not associated with patient immobilisation, bladder dysfunction and hypotension \\[9\\]. The ICNB with cryotherapy is a newer technique with the advantage of blocking post-surgical pain for 1 to 3 months, while allowing the axons to regenerate. The risk for additional medication is therefore less. However, the disadvantage is the fact that the probes developed to induce this block are expensive and not refunded in Belgium. For this small randomized pilot study, 3 cryotherapy probes are given for free by the company AtriCure. This offers us the opportunity to study the outcome of ICNB with cryotherapy and ropivacaine (standard technique).\n\nPostoperative pain that is not effectively treated or controlled will lead to chronic pain which is hard to control. Because of this it is really important to have an effective strategy in the first 3 months post-op to reduce chronic pain \\[10, 11\\]. With this study the investigators want to compare 2 techniques to see which analgesic single-shot technique meets the patient's satisfaction and it will also determine the most cost-effective pain strategy. When ICNB with cryotherapy seems promising compared to ICNB with ropivacaine in terms of patient satisfaction and pain control, a larger trial can be initiated.\n\nThe results of this study will give the investigators a first idea whether ICNB with cryotherapy can offer a clear advantage over ICNB with ropivacaine.\n\nReferences\n\n1\\.

    "brief_summary": "Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RaB) has afforded proceduralists the ability to accurately reach the periphery of the lung for biopsy of pulmonary nodules1. This has paved the way for patients to undergo both biopsy of a peripheral nodule and a staging linear endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in the same anesthesia event, promoting quicker throughput from discovery of a lesion to guideline-adherent treatment2. Further, introduction and mainstream utilization of cone-beam CT (CBCT) has provided the bronchoscopist the ability to refine needle position with tool-in-lesion confirmation3. While there are no randomized clinical trials promoting efficacy of RaB and CBCT in comparison with other bronchoscopic methods, in single center retrospective studies, diagnostic yield has consistently proven to be in the 70-85% range, superior to prior technologies4-6.\n\nOne of the limitations of utilization of RaB and CBCT is the detrimental effect that atelectasis plays in the bronchoscopy procedure. This can lead to false positive radial EBUS (rEBUS) signals and non-diagnostic procedures7. This incidence of atelectasis has been evaluated prospectively, using a protocol featuring 8-10 cmH2O of PEEP and limiting hyperoxia8, and results suggest this ventilator strategy does an adequate job preventing intraprocedural lung collapse. However, this study only evaluated incidence of atelectasis and did not elaborate on its impact on diagnostic yield.\n\nFurther unknown is the optimal sequence of performance of RaB and a staging linear EBUS in patients with a radiographically normal mediastinum. Starting with either the RaB or Linear EBUS both have their pros and cons. The benefit to performance of a linear EBUS first is the potential to obviate the need for peripheral nodule biopsy by obtaining rapid, on-site pathologic feedback of occult nodal disease, reducing some of the risk of the procedure (i.e. bleeding and pneumothorax).6 Conversely, the pitfalls to performing linear EBUS first is the possible contribution of atelectasis resultant of the increased time from intubation to peripheral nodule biopsy, blood in the airway causing bronchospasm, and resorption atelectasis from hyperoxia9. There are no prospective data evaluating this in a randomized fashion, but one Monte Carlo simulation (with assumption of diagnostic yield from navigational bronchoscopy of 70% when performed first and 60% when performed second) suggested a higher diagnostic yield and less need for repeat procedure in the navigation first group, despite a 10% assumption of occult nodal disease10.\n\nAs outlined in the specific aims above, the overarching goals of this study are to assess in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial performed by members of the Interventional Pulmonary Outcomes Group (IPOG), whether sequence of staging EBUS plays a role in diagnostic yield, incidence of atelectasis, and safety outcomes in patients undergoing RaB.",

    "detailed_description": "The trial will investigate HTL0039732, a novel specific E-type prostanoid receptor 4 (EP4) antagonist, as a monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). The trial may be expanded in future to also evaluate HTL0039732 in combination with other approved anti-cancer therapies. HTL0039732 is a small molecule drug that blocks activation of EP4 receptors by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a naturally occurring substance in the body.\n\nProstaglandin E2 may be elevated in cancer and signalling via the EP4 receptor can lead to suppression of immune activity, allowing the cancer to escape from the immune system. Blocking the EP4 receptor may relieve that immunosuppression, allowing the immune system to be active against the cancer again.\n\nAtezolizumab is an established immune checkpoint inhibitor that overcomes a key immunosuppressive signal and improves the magnitude and quality of tumour-specific T-cell responses, resulting in improved anti-cancer activity. It, and other similar agents, are approved for the treatment of several different types of cancer. As a common mechanism of immune suppression, immune checkpoint inhibitors also have a role in combination immunotherapies and combining EP4 inhibition by HTL0039732 with PD-L1 blockade by atezolizumab, is expected to have increased activity.\n\nThe trial will investigate HTL0039732 as a monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab, and potentially with other approved anti-cancer therapies, in participants with advanced solid tumours (Phase 1 Part A) and in participants with advanced solid tumours where PGE2/EP4 signalling is believed to be more prevalent or significant (Phase 1 Part B and Phase 2a).\n\nThis is a first-in-human clinical trial and is split as follows:\n\n* Phase 1 is the 'dose escalation' phase, where two groups (known as Part A and Part B) of participants with solid tumours will receive increasing doses of HTL0039732 to find the safest dose.\n* Part A participants will receive HTL0039732 as a single agent.\n* Part B participants will receive HTL0039732 in combination with atezolizumab.\n* More Parts may be added in future for participants to receive HTL0039732 in combination with other approved anti-cancer therapies.\n* Phase 2a is the 'dose expansion' phase, where participants grouped according to the type of cancer they have will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of HTL0039732 in combination with atezolizumab, and potentially in combination with other approved anti-cancer therapies. Phase 2a will follow a response enrichment approach; activity of the investigational medicinal products will be assessed in each group and ongoing recruitment will focus on tumour types with promising signals.\n\nThe main aims of the clinical trial are to find out:\n\n* The most appropriate dose of HTL0039732 administered on its own, and the most appropriate dose/s of HTL0039732 to take forward for further investigation in combination with atezolizumab and with other approved anti-cancer therapies.\n* More about any potential side effects of HTL0039732 when given alone and in combination with atezolizumab and other approved anti-cancer therapies.",

    "brief_summary": "Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases. Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction. The variability of airway obstruction is triggered by different factors that lead to a variety of different asthma phenotypes and subtypes. The various classification options for asthma (e.g. severity, by the predominantly existing inflammation or according to triggers), reflect its heterogeneity.\n\nDespite improved therapeutic methods, the prevalence and morbidity of asthma has increased worldwide in the last years. Asthma is a serious and growing global health problem with around 300 million people affected, independent of age or sex. Estimated 250'000 people die prematurely each year due to their asthma.\n\nBased on the SAPALDIA-study, the prevalence of Asthma in Switzerland is approximately 2-8%. Asthma is considered as a major factor in healthcare cost with up to CHF 1.2 billion per year. Asthma is not only a financial burden to a system; it affects the individual Quality of life negatively. Often health care professionals and patients underestimate the severity of the disease and overestimate asthma control. Severe asthma should not be equated with uncontrolled asthma. To reach a satisfying asthma control numerous factors need to be taken into consideration. Severe asthma is often associated with a high risk of frequent, severe exacerbations, which can even lead to death.\n\nSeveral severe asthma cohorts and registries already exists and are reported in the literature. The aim of such registries is in general data collection and a better understanding of the disease. So far, most epidemiological studies on severe asthma are cross-sectional with no follow up measures. Only a few studies did repeated measures using the same methods.\n\nApproximately 5% of all Asthma Patients suffers from severe asthma. These patients require systematic assessment and specialist care in dedicated respiratory centres. These centres have a key role in improving the outcome for severe asthma patients. At the same time they act as gatekeepers to ensure appropriate access to new, expensive therapies, this includes antibody treatment and interventional methods such as thermoplasty. These treatments require careful monitoring. It is important to ensure that they are given to the right population. Special assessment to monitor the efficacy and to prevent inappropriate prescribing, exposure of patients to unnecessary risks and excessive costs is indicated.\n\nFor all the mentioned reasons a Swiss Severe Asthma Register and a collaboration with an already existing register is needed to prospectively collect data about severe asthma in Switzerland.",
    "detailed_description": "The overall objective is to establish a clinical register for patients with severe asthma. Since the number of patients with severe asthma at a single center is usually low, it will be important to collect data in a multi-center system to optimize the diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with severe asthma. So far, there is little reliable information about the frequency, phenotype and therapy of patients with severe asthma. The construction of a clinical register should close this gap. The primary objective is to show changes in symptoms control during follow up period and at study end by using the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Secondary endpoints are to collect data to better understand asthma's natural history in patients with severe asthma. The examination will be based on the assessment of the parameters specified under \"outcomes\".\n\nPatients presenting to participating study center (pulmonologists in private practice or in pulmonary departments in hospital within Switzerland) with severe asthma will be asked to take part in this study when corresponding to the eligibility criteria. All patients with severe asthma will be included in the register only after detailed information and written consent. After four months (for specific therapies) and after 12 months, patients should be re-evaluated for up to 15 years. These follow-up data will also be recorded in the register. During the follow-up visits, the same parameters will be collected as during the initial Baselineexamination (some parameters will be omitted, for example, therapy received or requested for the defined period of the last 12 months, etc.). Severe asthma patients receiving a new specific therapy, e.g. obtained with antibodies, but who cannot be included in the register with the complete parameter profile due to time or capacity reasons of the centers, should be recorded at least with defined basic data and a reduced number of parameters in the register. These parameters include according to the specific asthma approved specific therapies, socio-demographic data, lung function values, laboratory values, parameters of asthma control, smoking status and add-on- therapy. This should make it possible to record a subgroup of severe asthmatics that are suitable for antibody therapy and at the same time offer the attending physician the opportunity to adequately document these complex and expensive therapies by recording the defined parameters. In these patients, an evaluation of the therapy response should be carried out after four months and documented in the register. Thereafter, there is an annual follow-up. At any time, these patients can be transferred to the full version of the register by entering the missing parameters. Patients for whom only the basic data is available (basic version) as well as patients with complete parameter profile in the register are kept in the same database and can be evaluated together. In general, no register-specific examinations will be carried out, but only parameters anyway recorded routinely.\n\nSince this is a cohort study, no sample size calculation can be calculated. Evaluations are carried out continuously. The collective of the data should be described by descriptive statistics concerning the basic data as well as the data of the function diagnostics. Subentities of severe asthma should be identified by a cluster analysis.",

The TTV levels correlate with infectious diseases and organ rejection and are therefore currently being investigated as a tool to optimize the management of patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT). While TTV levels are already tested to guide immunosuppressive therapy its significance for oncologic patients is unclear. In recent years immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are increasingly implemented in multimodal therapy approaches for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since ICI and TTV levels depend on T-cell function, the TTV load may be a relevant biomarker for the treatment response as well as complication risk after ICI therapy. Current standard imaging using PERCIST and RECIST criteria is prone to misinterpretation of treatment response of ICI therapy due to pseudoprogression and nodal immune flaring. This study aims to prospectively analyze TTV levels in NSCLC patients before, during and after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy and correlate inter- and intraindividual changes in TTV levels with response rates observed on PET/CT restaging and histopathological response rates as well as postoperative outcome.",

Commercial cigarette smoking accounts for half of all deaths among AIANs nationwide. AIANs' often lack of access to smoking cessation interventions, which may be due to inequities in the healthcare system, lack of health insurance, living in rural areas, systemic racism, and historical trauma. There is also a lack of effective smoking cessation interventions for AIANs. Smartphone apps have the potential to deliver a low-cost smoking cessation intervention with wide reach to AIANs. Apps require no in-person delivery and no provider training, do not require integration into complex hospital systems, can be freely accessed on an app store, and are available at any time and any place. iCanQuit is a behavioral intervention designed to help adults stop smoking by teaching skills for coping with smoking urges, staying motivated, and preventing relapse.

However, metastases with limited number (oligometastasis) can represent a subtype and transition point between localized disease and widespread metastases. Thus, eliminating metastases could be advantageous and beneficial to the prognosis if feasible and permitted. Image-guided ablation therapy, such as microwave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and cryoablation, has attracted great interest as a minimally invasive approach against intrathoracic metastases. Recently, ablation has been used on patients with pulmonary metastases from various cancers. This technique yields high proportions of sustained complete responses and is associated with relatively low morbidity. This multicenter study focuses on the management of ablation of oligometastasis therapy combined with systemic therapy.",

In Belgium, the existence of patient education videos about radiotherapy is very limited. Making these kinds of videos is expensive and time consuming.

Development of targeted therapies in the context of precision medicine changed the way lung cancer was diagnosed and treated. Small molecule inhibitors, like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), are now standard first-line therapy for EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First-generation EGFR-TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib bind competitively to the ATP-binding site of EGFR TK domain. This binding in second-generation TKI afatinib is irreversible. These drugs have improved better outcome compared to standard conventional chemotherapy In spite of this, more than half of the patients with an EGFR TKI treatment develop resistance. Deletion in exon 19 and single point substitution L858R in exon 21 accounting for 44% and 41% of all EGFR mutations, respectively are the most common mutations in EGFR gene which cause this resistance in the patients. Asia has the highest prevalence of EGFR mutations (38.4%), followed by America (24.4%) and Europe (14.1%). Median progression-free survival of EGFR mutated NSCLC patients under erlotinib or gefitinib has been around 12 months and 5-year survival was 15%",

White blood cells can be changed with molecules called anti-CCR4 to express a chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which is a molecule that directs a white blood cell to attack other cells. The CAR in this study attacks the CCR4 protein found on your T-cell lymphoma. This type if therapy is called gene therapy. Gene therapy involves a person s own white blood cells modified to target cancer cells. More research is needed to find out if gene therapy can treat T-cell cancers and do it safely.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test safety of giving people with certain mature T-cell lymphomas their own white blood cells modified with anti-CCR-4 CAR.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 and older with certain mature T-cell lymphomas that have not responded to or have come back after treatment. They must have a T-cell lymphoma that has CCR4 on the surface of the cancer cells.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a medical history and physical exam. Tests of blood, urine, and heart and lung function will be done.\n\nParticipants will have tests:\n\nComputed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging scans: They will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine or a tube. Pictures of the inside of the body will be taken. Before the PET scan, they will get an injection of radioactive fluid in a vein in the arm. Before the MRI, they may get a contrast dye injected through a vein (IV) in the arm.\n\nA biopsy of the tumor may be taken. A bone marrow sample may be taken from the hip: The area will be numbed and a large needle inserted through the skin.\n\nLeukapheresis will be done to obtain T-cells that will be genetically modified to express anti-CCR4 CARs on T-cells: Blood is drawn through an IV in one arm, circulated through a machine, and then returned through an IV in the other arm.\n\nChemotherapy drugs will be given in an IV to prepare the body to accept the modified CAR T cells.\n\nThe modified cells will be given in an IV.\n\nParticipants will be followed for 15 years: This will require blood tests over the first 1-2 years followed by yearly visits and possibly telehealth updates....",

Subjects must be germline HLA-A\\*02 heterozygous, with tumors that express MSLN and have lost HLA-A\\*02 expression. The purpose of Phase 1 of this study is to determine the safety and the optimal dose of A2B694 (after PCLD) in participants with solid tumor disease. The purpose of Phase 2 of this study is to determine the further safety and efficacy (how well it treats the solid tumor disease) of A2B694.\n\nThe treatment available for these cancers and other solid tumors can be toxic, debilitating, and fatal. In the recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic setting, the intent of standard of care treatment is typically palliative rather than curative, and has not changed significantly in several decades. A2 Bio hypothesizes that A2B694 Tmod CAR T-cell therapy will enable the killing of tumor target cells (those cells that express MSLN and have LOH for HLA-A\\*02 protein). Additionally, normal healthy cells that maintain HLA-A\\*02 expression and co-express MSLN (eg, lung tissue) will not be targeted due to the blocker portion of the Tmod CAR T cell that acts as a self-regulated safety switch that protects normal tissue from damage. A2 Bio believes this will provide a therapeutic safety window compared to previous solid tumor targeting therapies. This hypothesis will be explored in the study.\n\nParticipants for this study must enroll and have their T cells collected (apheresis) in the pre-screening BASECAMP-1 study (NCT04981119). T cells are collected, processed and stored for each participant. Upon disease progression the participant may screen for this study (EVEREST-2) and the participant's T cells are manufactured and then infused following PCLD regimen. There is no time requirement between the studies, and patients may go directly from BASECAMP-1 to EVEREST-2 based on their own disease course.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of lamivudine in combination with standard of care chemoimmunotherapy in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Even though small cell lung cancer is initially highly responsive to first-line chemotherapy treatment, treatment resistance inevitably emerges; treatment resistance is when tumor cells stop responding to a drug treatment that they had previously responded to. Lamivudine is an oral antiviral a drug that may be able to reduce the ability of tumors to develop drug resistance. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lamivudine together with the usual standard of care chemoimmunotherapy may help prevent the growth and spread of the tumor cells to other parts of the body.",

At present, there is no unified drug treatment standard for HER2-negative breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM). The evidence of single traditional chemotherapy drug as the main treatment of brain metastasis is not sufficient. Some exploratory studies on HER2-negative BCBM have shown that the central nervous system objective response rate (CNS-ORR) of anti-angiogenic drugs combined with chemotherapy is around 55%-80%\u3002 Adebrelimab (a humanized PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) specifically blocks the binding of PD-1 and PD-L1, terminates the immunosuppressive signal produced by T cells, and makes T cells re-recognize tumor cells and kill them, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. In China, Adebelizumab has been approved for using in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Apatinib (a small molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) mainly plays an anti-angiogenic effect in the treatment of malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR. Apatinib has been approved monotherapy for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma that has progressed or relapsed after at least two systematic chemotherapies, advanced liver cancer that has failed or is intolerable after at least first-line systematic treatment, and first-line treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma combined with camrelizumab.\n\nDue to the lack of effective drug therapy for HER2-negative BCBM, a variety of treatment combinations are still being explored. We hypothesized that adebrelimab plus apatinib and etoposide is an explorable and effective treatment for HER2- negative BCBM.",

After receiving the initial dose, subjects undergo safety evaluations on Day 3 (including symptom assessment, physical examination, vital signs monitoring, 12-lead electrocardiogram, hematology, urinalysis, blood biochemistry, and coagulation function tests). The decision to proceed with subsequent administrations for subjects who have received the initial dose is made through discussion between the investigator and the sponsor (and/or CRO medical staff) based on safety profiles.\n\nThis study follows the \"3+3\" dose escalation principle, progressing from the low-dose group to the high-dose group sequentially. The sample size may be adjusted based on the actual circumstances of the trial, with each subject receiving only one corresponding dose. During the study, a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established, consisting of the investigators and representatives from the sponsor. The SMC will review the safety data generated during the study and make decisions regarding dose escalation, modification of escalation doses, alteration of dosing regimens, or study discontinuation. Only after all subjects in the preceding dose group have completed the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation, and the SMC confirms that the dose escalation criteria are met, the enrollment for the next dose group will begin.",

    "brief_summary": "Bone metastases represent a frequent complication of some solid tumours, particularly prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. Bone metastases can cause pain and give rise to the so-called \"Skeletal-related Events\" (SRE) such as pathological fractures and nerve compression. Despite advances in cancer treatment in general, treatment options for bone metastases remain inadequate and generally palliative. It is therefore necessary to identify patients at \"high risk\" of developing metastases at an early stage of neoplastic disease in order to counteract it. Therefore, the identification of changes in the expression of proteins that could be variously involved in the progression of breast cancer is of primary importance since they could act as prognostic factors and therefore address the therapeutic strategy. The aim of the investigators is to clarify the role of de-regulation of post-translational events (such as SUMOylation) in the progression of breast cancer.",
    "detailed_description": "The most serious aspect of neoplastic disease is the spread of cancer cells to secondary sites, often distant from the primary site of growth. Bone is a breeding ground for many types of cancer, especially those derived from breast, prostate and lung. Despite the enormous progress in diagnosis and therapeutic strategies, bone metastases still have a profound impact on quality of life and survival, being often responsible for the outcome of the disease. To improve the outcome of patients with poor prognosis, a deep knowledge of the mechanisms underlying dissemination, colonization and progression of cancer cells in the bone is necessary.\n\nThe investigators therefore intend to clarify some pathogenic mechanisms involved in the growth of bone metastases, and to uncover predictive signs that underlie the spread of breast cancer cells to bone.\n\nPrimary aim of the investigators is to deepen the role of the de-regulation of post-translational events, such as Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier- (SUMO) SUMO-ylation in the progression of breast cancer. The expression of SENP1 (a member of the SUMO-specific protease family) in bone metastatic and non-metastatic mammary carcinomas will be evaluated. The evaluation of the expression of SENP1 in bone metastases will be finalised to define a possible use as a therapeutic target. SENP1 could be a potential prognostic indicator of the neoplastic progression of breast cancer and a potential therapeutic target, but data on its participation in the process of metastasis to bone are still scarce. Moreover, the investigators try to deepen the knowledge of the interaction between tumour cells and bone microenvironment and the role of immunosurveillance as an important part of the immune response against to neoplastic cells. Finally, the investigators will analyze the role of autophagy and apoptosis in the dissemination and growth of metastases due to the capacity of autophagy to provide energy, nutrients and resistance to anoikis, and to promote the dissemination of cancer cells and metastatic growth.",

Additionally, the diagnostic and therapeutic cycle for malignant ovarian cancer is prolonged and unpredictable, predominantly focusing on post-surgical interventions.\n\nIn our preliminary studies, we identified that the A allele of SNP-rs1192691, associated with ovarian cancer prognosis, promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion by activating the Rho signaling pathway. The Rho signaling pathway inhibitor Fasudil has been shown to effectively suppress the proliferation and invasion of A/A genotype tumor cells in murine models.

Cancer is still one of the leading causes of death in Western countries. In 2014, there were an estimated 1,665,540 new cancer cases and 585,720 deaths in the United States alone. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and Eurostat predict 1,323,600 deaths in Europe, a figure slightly down on previous statistics but still underlining the existence and seriousness of the problem. It is no coincidence that cancer is one of the main areas of investment in the European Horizon 2020 programme. In recent years, the hypothesis that the process of carcinogenesis is driven by the activation of a particular panel of genes/proteins that enable cancer cells to acquire malignant characteristics has become increasingly popular. This process goes by the name Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and characterises all human epithelial tumours. This process allows epithelial tumour cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics giving them stem, invasive, and chemoresistant properties.",

CTD-ILD is one of its common categories and includes any ILD with a definite diagnosis of connective tissue disease or with a set of symptoms, signs, and abnormalities suggested by laboratory examination. The incidence of CTD-ILD varies from home to abroad. Foreign studies indicate that the number of CTD-ILD in this study accounted for 34.8% of the total number of ILD in this study, while domestic studies indicate that the number of CTD-ILD in this study accounted for 67% of the total number of ILD. At present, the treatment of CTD-ILD includes hormone, immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide, mortemycophenate, tacrolimus, etc. The above treatment has great side effects, which may increase the risk of infection and the incidence of malignant tumor. Traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages in alleviating the clinical symptoms of the disease, reducing the use of hormones and hormone complications, and preventing infection. Qifangfeixian granule is derived from \"Fangji Huangqi Decoction\" in the Summary of Golden Chamber. Modern pharmacology shows that Huangqi has the functions of regulating immunity, protecting liver, antibacterial and antiviral, etc. In order to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using Qifangfeixian granule (Huangqi, Fangji, dogwood, dodder, ginkgo, salvia miltiorrhizae, Taoren, etc.) in the treatment of CTD-ILD patients, Determined to explore a path of CTD-ILD treatment with Chinese characteristics, we hereby apply for a multicenter controlled clinical study.",

    "brief_summary": "The Sponsor is developing KB707, a replication-defective, non-integrating herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-derived vector designed to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response through the production of cytokines within the local tumor microenvironment in the lungs. KB707 is administered via nebulization, delivering the therapy directly through the airways to the lungs of subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies.\n\nThis is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and immunologic effect of KB707.\n\nMonotherapy KB707 dose escalation and expansion cohorts enrolled adults with advanced solid tumor malignancies affecting the lungs who had progressed on standard of care therapy, cannot tolerate standard of care therapy, or refused standard of care therapy. The dose escalation phase (Cohorts 1 and 2) evaluated KB707 monotherapy using a standard 3+3 design, followed by a dose expansion phase (Cohort 4) to further evaluate the selected dose. Subjects received inhaled KB707 weekly for three weeks, then every three weeks. The dose escalation portion of the study is now complete, and the selected dose is being evaluated in the expansion phase.\n\nCombination regimens with a selected (fixed) dose of KB707 are being evaluated in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects in Cohorts 5 and 6 are receiving inhaled KB707 once every 2 weeks (q2w), delivered in combination with Keytruda once every 6 weeks. Subjects in Cohort 7 are receiving inhaled KB707 in combination with docetaxel once every 3 weeks.\n\nAll subjects will be treated until tumor progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration, achievement of maximal response, subject choice, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or the Sponsor determines to terminate the study.",

Among various ablation techniques, cryoablation has been demonstrated to be therapeutic efficacy with several advantages, including high safety, clear ablation borders, and minimal local pain. With the development of navigational bronchoscopy, pilot study on transbronchial cryoablation for peripheral lung cancer has proved its efficacy and safety, but there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled trials to verify its near-term as well as long-term efficacy and safety.

    "detailed_description": "Small cell lung cancer is a highly malignant tumor that accounts for about 15% of all lung cancer types. The 5-year survival rate is less than 5%, and the overall survival of patients who do not receive any antitumor therapy is only 2-4 months. In the past 40 years, 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, that is, etoposide combined with cisplatin or carboplatin, has become the standard therapy for small cell lung cancer patients and has been recommended by major global tumor treatment guidelines. While initial response rates are as high as 70%, 80% of limited-stage patients and nearly all patients with extensive stages are found to experience relapse or disease progression. Current guidelines recommend that patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer adopt the EP regimen combined with thoracic radiotherapy as the preferred treatment for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 is part of a complex system of receptors and ligands involved in controlling T cell activation. PD-L1 acts at multiple sites in the body, releasing inhibitory signals to T cells via the PD-1 and CD80 receptors to help regulate the immune response. Durvalumab is an immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1-\u03basubtype monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 in T cells and CD80 (B7.1) in immune cells (ics). This trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of durvalumab combined with chemoradiotherapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer.",

These patients may change to an alternate regime based on response or biologic features and noted in section 5.1. Prior biopsy or surgery is allowed.\n* Prior radiation therapy is not allowed if directed at the abdomen.

(Lymph node involvement in the thorax, or other extra-abdominal sites is a criterion for Stage IV)\n  * The tumor has penetrated through the peritoneal surface\n  * Tumor implants are found on the peritoneal surface\n  * Gross or microscopic tumor remains post-operatively (e.g., tumor cells are found at the margin of surgical resection on microscopic examination - in the post chemotherapy setting only specific types of viable tumor at the surgical margin are considered stage III AND require adjuvant radiation - see surgery / pathology / radiation section for additional details)\n  * The tumor is not completely resectable because of local infiltration into vital structures\n  * Tumor spillage occurring either before or during surgery\n  * A trans abdominal biopsy (regardless of type- tru-cut, open or fine needle aspiration) was performed prior to resection or chemotherapy. Retroperitoneal biopsies DO NOT require radiotherapeutic management like stage III\n  * Tumor is removed in greater than one piece (e.g. tumor cells are found in a separately excised adrenal gland; a tumor thrombus within the renal vein is removed separately from the nephrectomy specimen). Extension of the primary tumor within vena cava into thoracic vena cava and heart is considered Stage III, rather than Stage IV even though outside the abdomen.\n* Stage IV - Hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, brain, etc.), or lymph node metastases outside the abdomino-pelvic region are present.

    "detailed_description": "Patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) are tools to assess patients' views on aspects of their health and condition, including health-related quality of life, symptom status, physical function and mental health. In medical oncology, PROMs are emerging as useful indicators not only of patient well-being, but also of treatment efficacy. Measurement of quality of life (QoL) has an intrinsic role in the definition of treatment value and, in the absence of head-to-head comparisons showing differences in overall survival or other traditional endpoints, comparison in terms of QoL can usefully inform the choice among alternative treatment options. The recent availability of alternative strategies in advanced NSCLC, in particular different combination therapies in first line setting, requires models to support clinical decision in tailoring individual treatments. In this model, the integration of PROMs could be essential in promoting a patient-centered approach to cancer care.\n\nEORTC QLQ-C-30, exploring general functioning, and EORTC LC-13, specific for lung cancer are the most used PROMs tools in thoracic oncology.\n\nQoL is a complex and composite outcome, which includes different aspects of patients' well-being, such as anxiety, depression and emotional stress. The latter has been measured in patients with lung cancer using PHQ-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scales. Of note, a significant association with reduced response and worse survival upon immunotherapy was reported, suggesting an impact of emotional stress on patients' immune system and consequently on treatment outcomes.\n\nConsidering the broad effect of immunotherapy on the endocrine system and hormones' functions, it is likely that sexual health and sleep, other nuances of the QoL field, could be also affected by immunotherapy. So far, both sexual and sleep dysfunctions have been poorly explored in clinical trials. Furthermore, \"time toxicity\" defined as number of days with physical contact with healthcare system, could significantly affect patients' emotional distress sphere and has never been explored in NSCLC upon chemo-immunotherapy combinations.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we believe that chemo-ICI (4 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy + anti- PD-1 followed by single agent chemo and immunotherapy maintenance) or double-ICI chemo (2 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy + anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, followed by maintenance with combo immunotherapy) regimens may have distinct effects on several QoL domains. This could be due to the intrinsic differences in the drugs used (i.e. addition of anti-CTLA-4 agents), treatment related toxicities and different tumor shrinkage activity.\n\nThe present study aims to compare QoL by validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C-30, EORTC LC13) in the two above mentioned cohorts of patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, having an additional focus in sexual (EORTC QLQ-SH-22), emotional stress (PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale) and sleep disorders (PSQI) as previously reported. Time toxicity will be measured by analyzing the time patients spend in contact with healthcare system, such as visits and treatment. A defined cut off considers time toxicity severe when it exceeds 20% of the total care time.",

    "brief_summary": "PRODIPET Study Summary\n\nTitle: Multicenter Registry for Chest Wall Reconstruction Using Custom 3D-Printed Titanium Prostheses\n\nPurpose\n\nThe PRODIPET study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of personalized, dynamic titanium prostheses for reconstructing the chest wall after:\n\nTumor resection (e.g., sarcomas, lung cancer). Severe trauma (e.g., multiple rib fractures). Traditional methods (metal plates, mesh) often lack flexibility, potentially causing pain or breathing difficulties. This study tests 3D-printed titanium implants designed to mimic natural rib movement, improving function and comfort.\n\nStudy Design\n\nType: Multicenter, ambispective (retrospective + prospective data).\n\nDuration:\n\nProspective: 24 months (Jan 2024-Jan 2026). Follow-up: 12 months per patient (final analysis by 2027). Centers: Major Spanish hospitals (Ram\u00f3n y Cajal/Madrid, La Ribera/Alzira, Cruces/Baracaldo, Insular/Las Palmas).\n\nKey Goals\n\nAssess short/mid-term outcomes (pain, breathing, complications). Compare results across patients/surgical techniques. Improve future prosthesis designs. Who Can Participate?\n\nInclusion:\n\nAdults (18+) needing chest wall reconstruction. Signed consent for anonymized data sharing.\n\nExclusion:\n\nTitanium allergies. Participation in conflicting studies. Patient Experience\n\nPre-Surgery:\n\nCT scan creates a custom 3D prosthesis (made by Osteobionix\u00ae using Ti6AL4V-ELI titanium).\n\nSurgery:\n\nSurgeons implant the prosthesis, anchoring it to ribs/sternum.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nEvaluations at discharge, 1/6/12 months (in-person or phone). Measures: Pain, lung function, imaging (X-ray/CT), complications (e.g., infection, implant failure).\n\nPrivacy \\& Ethics\n\nData is anonymized and stored securely (REDCap system). Complies with European General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and Spanish data protection laws.\n\nPatients may withdraw anytime. For Healthcare Providers\n\nCollaboration: Open to thoracic surgeons/researchers. Data Access: Centralized via REDCap; analyzed by the coordinating team. Publications: Multicenter results will be published first; individual centers may later share their data.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nAddresses a gap in evidence for dynamic prostheses, which may offer:\n\nBetter breathing mechanics vs. rigid materials. Fewer long-term complications (e.g., breakage). Could standardize best practices for complex reconstructions.

    "brief_summary": "The study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness and safety of tubeless anesthesia in single-port thoracoscopic surgery for early-stage lung cancer patients. Traditional anesthesia methods risk postoperative complications like lung injury and respiratory issues. Tubeless anesthesia preserves spontaneous breathing without tracheal intubation, potentially reducing these complications and enhancing recovery. The study aims to compare this technique with traditional methods, assessing its impact on contralateral lung complications, perioperative hemodynamics, complication rates, and recovery speed.",
    "detailed_description": "With changes in lifestyle and environment, the incidence of early-stage lung cancer has been increasing annually. Traditional open surgical treatments have drawbacks such as significant trauma and noticeable pain, which has led to increased interest in minimally invasive surgery. In recent years, with continuous advancements in technology, single-port thoracoscopic surgery has become a popular choice for minimally invasive procedures, offering advantages such as minimal intraoperative trauma, mild postoperative pain, and good cosmetic results. However, traditional tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation carry a range of potential side effects, including pressure-induced injury, lung overdistension, and the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, ventilator-associated lung injury occurs in about 4% of patients undergoing lung resection, with a mortality rate reaching up to 25%. The possibility of subclinical lung injury may also be underestimated. Furthermore, orotracheal and bronchial intubation can lead to various local complications, including upper respiratory tract pain, mucosal ulcers, and injury to the larynx or trachea. General anesthesia might have harmful systemic side effects, whereas local anesthesia does not pose such issues for awake patients or those with minimal sedation. Moreover, the use of muscle relaxants can lead to diaphragmatic dysfunction and atelectasis. Intravenous analgesics, especially opioids, are associated with postoperative vomiting, nausea, and respiratory depression. Importantly, postoperative pulmonary complications are among the most common complications following such surgeries, including atelectasis, lung infections, and pleural effusions, which can severely affect patient recovery and even be life-threatening. Therefore, it is crucial to find an anesthesia technique that ensures surgical efficacy while reducing postoperative pulmonary complications.\n\nTubeless anesthesia, which implies retaining spontaneous breathing without tracheal intubation, refers to a general anesthesia technique that does not involve tracheal intubation during thoracoscopic surgery. It employs airway devices that do not invade the trachea, alongside regional anesthesia and intravenous sedation and analgesics, to preserve spontaneous breathing. As a new anesthetic technique emerging in recent years, it offers several advantages over traditional methods, such as faster recovery, alignment with the needs of minimally invasive surgery, and a reduction in postoperative complications. Currently, the reported application range of tubeless anesthesia is extensive, encompassing simple lung biopsies, bullectomies, treatments for hyperhidrosis, as well as wedge resections, lobectomies, segmentectomies, and mediastinal tumor surgeries, even including complex tracheal tumor resections and carina reconstructions. The surgical approaches include multipoint and single-port procedures, as well as Da Vinci robotic surgeries. Although retrospective studies have confirmed the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of tubeless anesthesia in thoracoscopic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, the focus has predominantly been on the occurrence of ipsilateral lung complications.\n\nCurrently, reports on the preventive value and safety of this technique for contralateral lung complications in single-port thoracoscopic surgery in early-stage lung cancer patients are scarce, and prospective research evidence is lacking. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to apply tubeless anesthesia in single-port thoracoscopic surgery for early-stage lung cancer patients, and to compare the incidence of contralateral lung complications three days postoperatively, perioperative hemodynamics, perioperative complication rates, and recovery speed with patients having similar baseline conditions who underwent traditional single-lumen tube + blocking tube or double-lumen tracheal intubation general anesthesia, to verify its clinical value.",

    "detailed_description": "According to the definition of the World Health Organization, stroke is defined as \"rapidly developing clinical manifestations of focal (or global) impairment of cerebral function that lasts longer than 24 hours or may result in death and has no apparent cause other than vascular origin\". Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world. It is also the leading cause of disability and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions and health expenditures in industrialized societies. Stroke has many complications, one of which is fatigue. Fatigue can be defined as a decrease in physical and/or mental performance resulting from changes in central, psychological and/or environmental factors. Normal fatigue is a generalized state of tiredness resulting from overexertion and improves with rest. In contrast, \"pathologic fatigue\", often experienced by patients with neurological disorders, is chronic fatigue unrelated to previous levels of exertion and usually does not improve with rest. Post-stroke fatigue can be considered as a type of pathologic fatigue. Post-stroke fatigue is one of the most common symptoms 3 months after stroke. Half of the patients may still experience fatigue 1 year after stroke and this condition may last for years. The prevalence of post-stroke fatigue has been reported to vary between 39% and 68%. Post-stroke fatigue negatively affects the quality of life of stroke patients and constitutes a significant barrier to recovery, especially in participation in rehabilitation programs. Therefore, understanding post-stroke fatigue is an important issue for healthcare professionals in terms of implementing effective rehabilitation programs in patients with stroke. However, little is known about the etiology and effective management of post-stroke fatigue. Numerous factors have been shown to be associated with post-stroke fatigue, including age, gender, depression, stroke severity, stroke type and lesion location, pain, but these risk factors are not consistent across all studies. The lack of appropriate objective measurement tools may be one of the reasons for the poor understanding of post-stroke fatigue. Several tools are available to assess fatigue, including the Fatigue Rating Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Visual Analogue Scale-Fatigue. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is the most commonly used fatigue assessment scale in stroke patients and was originally developed to measure fatigue in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. In the literature, there are studies investigating the frequency of fatigue after stroke and its relationship with various demographic and clinical parameters. In our country, there are a few studies evaluating the frequency of fatigue after stroke. There is no complete clarity in terms of both the frequency and the factors associated with fatigue in the studies. Our primary aim in this study is to determine the frequency of post-stroke fatigue in first-time stroke patients admitted to our clinic. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between fatigue severity and demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients such as age, gender, education level, stroke type, stroke duration and severity of pain, anxiety, depression, sleep status, motor and cognitive function, spasticity, physical capacity, functional ambulation, level of independence in activities of daily living and health-related quality of life.\n\nMethod: The study will include patients who were diagnosed with stroke for the first time according to the World Health Organization definition, who were over 18 years of age, whose general condition was stable after stroke and at least 3 months have passed since the event, among the patients followed up in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine Ibn-i Sina and Cebeci hospitals. This study will be conducted within the scope of good clinical practices and all patients will be asked to give consent to the study by reviewing the informed consent form before the study.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Being diagnosed with stroke according to definition by the World Health Organization\n* Being over 18 years of age\n* Having had a stroke confirmed by Computed Tomography (CT) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n* At least 3 months after stroke\n* At least stage 2 according to the Functional Ambulation Classification\n* Agreed to participate in the study and signed the informed consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous history of stroke\n* Communication problems due to reasons such as aphasia and dementia\n* Patients who are illiterate\n* Cognitive functional impairment who cannot take commands (MMSE\\<24)\n* D\u0130agnoses such as cancer, heart failure, liver failure, renal failure that may cause fatigue\n* Signs of systemic infection\n* History of subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nDemographic information (gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, occupation), medical history, type of lesion (ischemic, hemorrhagic), duration of disease, laboratory values such as vitamin B12, vitamin D, hemoglobin and albumin levels and current treatments will be obtained from the patients who agree to participate in the study and meet the inclusion criteria and this information will be recorded in the patient follow-up form. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) will be used to assess fatigue after stroke. In addition, the Visual Analog Scale-Fatigue (VAS-Fatigue) will be used to determine the severity of fatigue. Pain severity will be assessed using the Visual Analog Scale-Pain (VAS-Pain), depression and anxiety will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, sleep quality will be assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale, motor function will be assessed using the Brunnstrom Motor Recovery Staging, and cognitive function will be assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The level of spasticity will be assessed with the Modified Ashworth Scale, physical capacity with the 6-minute walk test, functional ambulation with the Functional Ambulation Classification, independence in activities of daily living with the Modified Barthel Index, and health-related quality of life with the Stroke Impact Scale v3.0",

Dacomitinib/afatinib treatment might be switched to osimertinib in the event of treatment failure, provided that an EGFR T790M mutation is detected. However, in about half of patients with second generation EGFR- TKI treatment failure, the resistance mechanism is different from T790M. Thus, there is a need to identify which patients that benefit from osimertinib in first line and which patients that rather benefit from a second-generation EGFR-TKI in first line, respectively. Early treatment prediction and monitoring through biomarkers in blood and tumor could be one step forward in individualized treatment.\n\nAfter being informed about the study patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC, considered for first-line treatment, will sign a consent and undergo a screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. When screening is completed, and inclusion criteria are met, study participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to osimertinib or afatinib/dacomitinib.\n\nPatients randomized to afatinib/dacomitinib will be able to cross-over to osimertinib in the event of progression and confirmed T790M-mutation. In the event of progression on osimertinib or on afatinib/dacomitinib without T790M, the study participants will be treated as chosen by the investigator and in accordance with applicable national guidelines.\n\nLongitudinal blood samples and, when appropriate, tumor tissue/cytology or other fluids (pleural effusion etc.) will be assembled and used for comprehensive analysis to study potential biomarkers.",

The investigators aim to conduct immunologic studies across tumor types and treatment modalities in order to accomplish the following:\n\n1. Gain mechanistic insights into the potential influence of various forms of cancer therapy on antitumor immunity, including but not limited to chemotherapies, kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, immune-modulating monoclonal antibodies, cellular immune therapies and radiation therapy.\n2. Define new tumor antigens and the tumor antigens' relevance to disease biology, and correlate antigen expression with immune responses and disease outcomes.\n3. Evaluate potential immune-related prognostic or treatment response indicators.\n4. Assess the immunologic features of pre-malignant lesions (e.g., atypical or dysplastic nevi, dysplastic bronchial epithelium, colonic adenomas), and compare these features to features of invasive cancers.\n5. Investigate the immunobiology of neoadjuvant and adjuvant cancer therapies, including but not limited to cancer vaccines.\n6. Develop protein-, RNA-, and DNA-based blood markers to monitor tumor burden and predict and detect tumor relapse.\n7. Evaluate the causative mechanisms of immune-related toxicities in patients receiving cancer therapy with immune checkpoint blockade.\n8. Characterize factors and molecular pathways in the tumor immune microenvironment that lead to immune suppression, tolerance to tumor antigens, and cancer progression.\n9. Understand the epidemiology of and risk factors for particular immune related adverse events (irAEs) including inflammatory arthritis, sicca syndrome and myositis\n10. Perform integrative genomic, transcriptomic and immune repertoire characterization of cancers with differential responses to immunotherapy and cancer therapies to determine the molecular features of responding and resistant tumors.\n11. Study clonal evolution through genomic, neoantigen, transcriptomic, spatial transcriptomic, and immune repertoire analyses in order to map the evolutionary trajectories of cancer and immune cells under selective pressure of cancer therapies including immune checkpoint blockade.\n12. Employ non-invasive molecular assays and analyses of circulating cell-free tumor DNA to capture peripheral tumor and immune compartment dynamics as they relate to response to cancer therapies including immunotherapy.\n\nTo support the above research aims, biological specimens obtained and processed in the individual laboratories of the co-investigators will be linked by a centralized demographic database, allowing for the retrieval of information regarding specimen characteristics (e.g., tumor type, treatment exposure, date of specimen retrieval, anatomic site of biopsy, biopsy procedure) and clinical outcomes. Participants starting on immune checkpoint inhibitors will complete a survey when the participants enroll on study to assess for potential risk factors for irAE development. Participants will also undergo knee radiographs to evaluate for osteoarthritis, baseline survey for personal and family historical risk factors, and serial surveys designed to screen for development of irAEs This information will be correlated with the results of exploratory scientific analyses conducted in the laboratories of the co-investigators.

Patients who are scheduled for elective thoracic surgeries via posterolateral thoracotomy incision and fulfilling the inclusion criteria in Fayoum university hospital starting from March 2024 will be enrolled in this randomized controlled study until fulfilling sample size. A detailed informed consent will be signed by the eligible participants before recruitment.\n\nThe patients will be randomized into two groups: MTP block group and TPV block group in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random table. The patient's assigned group information will be elicited from a sealed opaque envelope by the anesthesiologist who will perform the US-guided MTP and TPV block and will not be involved in further data collection or patient care. The patients and both the surgical and anesthesia teams, who are responsible for patient care and data collection are blinded from the group assignments.\n\nIn this study, no premedication will be given to the patients before the operation. All patients will be monitored using electrocardiography, pulse-oximetry, capnography. An arterial line will be inserted using a 20 G cannula either right or left radial artery for invasive blood pressure monitoring in the operating room.\n\nAfter pre-oxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced with intravenous propofol (2 mg/kg) and fentanyl (1 \u03bcg/kg). After muscle relaxation with atracurium (0.5mg/kg), tracheal intubation will be performed by a cuffed endotracheal tube (7-7.5) size and mechanical ventilation will be applied while maintaining the end-tidal CO2 between 30 and 35 mmHg. Maintenance of anesthesia will be made using inhalational anesthesia (isoflurane) and IV atracurium according to the patients' requirements. The anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane starting at one MAC and will be adjusted to obtain an adequate level of anesthesia by titrating the concentration according to the BIS monitoring (BIS Complete Monitoring System P/N 185-0151 Covidien IIc, 15 Hampshire Street, Mansfield, MA 02048 USA) to keep the BIS value between 40 and 60.\n\nAfter induction , the patient will be placed in the lateral decubitus position.

After negative aspiration of blood or air a total volume of 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25% will be injected displacing the pleura downwards.\n\nAfter 15 min , an incision will be made to perform the surgical procedure. . Continuous hemodynamic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate will be done . If the systolic blood pressure decreased to a 20% below the baseline or less than 90 mmHg, 5 mg of ephedrine will be injected IV. Moreover, if the heart rate reduced to a 50 bpm or less, 0.5 mg of atropine will be injected IV.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, isoflurane will be discontinued and the muscle relaxant will be antagonized with neostigmine (0.04-0.08 mg/kg) and atropine (0.01 mg/kg) and will be extubated when the patient meets the following criteria: awake or arousable, hemodynamically stable, no ongoing active bleeding, warm extremities, no electrolyte abnormalities, and a satisfactory arterial blood gas , after the return of spontaneous respiration.\n\nAfter admission to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) at the end of surgery, all patients will receive IV fentanyl via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with concentration 10 \u03bcg/ml , with bolus 15 \u03bcg and lockout interval 10 minutes and maximum dose of 90 \u03bcg/hr with no background dose for 24 hours. Paracetamol 1 gm IV will be given every 8 hours.. The patient's pain will be evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) both during rest and with cough (0: no pain, 10: worst pain ever) at time intervals: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24h postoperative.

It is characterized by irreversible loss of lung function due to fibrosis, which manifests itself with cough, dyspnea, and impaired quality of life. Lung transplantation is limited to a minority of patients and patients receive anti-fibrotic therapy in addition to supportive/palliative treatments. In light of the broad definition of pulmonary rehabilitation, and by virtue of the multidisciplinary nature of the process, the present study aims to observe the effects of the rehabilitation counseling offered to patients who attend the IPF clinic at the Pneumology Operating Unit of the IRCCS Company Bologna University Hospital, as part of the Intercompany PDTA (diagnostic therapeutic care path) for Pulmonary Fibrosis: the Intercompany PDTA for patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis involves a multidisciplinary approach which, also through therapeutic education/counselling, aims among others to \"Offer the patient the opportunity to participate in clinical studies to increase knowledge about the disease and/or have access to innovative treatments\". Primary objectives\n\n1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the rehabilitation intervention contained in the PDTAI (Intercompany diagnostic therapeutic care path )\n2. Evaluate the improvement in functional capacity and cardiorespiratory endurance.\n\n   Secondary objectives\n3. Evaluate the progress and evolution of the pathology.\n4. Evaluate the emotional burden of the caregiver in caring for the individual suffering from IPF\n5. Evaluate the improvement in quality of life.\n6. Evaluate the change in disability.\n7. Evaluate the patient\\&#39;s fatigue and its evolution over the course of the disease. Fatigue is associated with dyspnea, impacts daily living activities and quality of life.\n8. Evaluate the progress and evolution of dyspnea at rest and in relation to the performance of common daily activities.\n\nThe study plans to enroll 40 patients newly diagnosed with IPF\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\n* adulthood \u226518 years\n* Obtaining the patient\\&#39;s informed consent\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* diagnosis of cancer in the active phase\n* Situations of clinical instability, of clinical worsening such as to deem the individual unsuitable for treatment because they are no longer able to go to follow up visits The included patients will receive the therapeutic education brochure from the physiotherapist and will be trained to perform the exercises during hospital visits. The physiotherapist will be able to evaluate and modify the retraining program based on the user\\&#39;s response according to the principles based on the individualized rehabilitation project. The direct comparison with the user allows to obtain a functional improvement adapted to the needs and performance of the person but at the same time, according to the principles of empowerment, helps the subject to become aware of their functional limits and address them with a more personalized.\n\nThe sessions will be planned following the criteria of frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise:\n\nFrequency: one meeting/every fifteen days in the first month and one meeting every fifteen days (+/- five days) in the second and third months.\n\nIntensity: sixty minutes (with mBorg three dyspnea and minimum peripheral saturation 88%) Time: sixty minutes Type of treatment: exercises from the therapeutic education brochure.\n\nEndpoints measures:\n\n1. % of patients participating in the physiotherapy session programme. It is expected that at least 80% of the total enrolled participants will participate in the proposed session cycle.\n2. Six Minute Walking Test.

    "detailed_description": "The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about a study medicine called Ibuzatrelvir for the possible treatment of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 have more difficulty fighting infections and are at risk for persistent infections and progression to severe illness. This patient population may benefit from extended antiviral treatment durations, or a combination of antiviral therapies. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibuzatrelvir with and without remdesivir compared with remdesivir alone for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 in adult participants who are severely immunocompromised.\n\nThe study is seeking adult male and female participants who:\n\n* Have a confirmed COVID-19 infection\n* Are severely immunocompromised due to blood cancers, organ transplant, certain medications or therapies\n* Have experienced the onset of signs or symptoms of COVID-19 within the past 5 days and are currently experiencing at least one of them.\n\nAll of the participants in this study will receive active treatment for COVID-19, and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms. One-third will received remdesivir, one-third will receive ibuzatrelvir, and one third will receive both remdesivir and ibuzatrelvir. Ibuzatrelvir will be taken by mouth twice daily, and remdesivir is given as an IV infusion daily. Placebos that look like the study medicines but do not have any medication will be given to make the 3 treatment arms appear to be the same. The study will compare the experiences of people receiving ibuzatrelvir with and without remdesivir to those of the people who only received remdesivir for COVID-19. This will help decide if ibuzatrelvir is safe and effective.\n\nParticipants will attend about 10 study visits over 24 weeks. During this time, they will have:\n\n* visits at the study clinic\n* blood work\n* swabs of the nose that are collected in the clinic and also by participants at home\n* questionnaires",

    "brief_summary": "Lungs are made up of individual lobes. When a lung cancer tumour is detected in one of these lobes, surgeons typically perform a Lobectomy. A Lobectomy is the surgery most commonly done to treat early-stage lung cancer and requires removal of an entire lobe of the lung, which removes a large amount of lung tissue For patients with small tumours saving as much healthy lung tissue as possible is important. Each lobe of the lung has smaller sections called segments. When a lung cancer is in one of these segments, it is possible to remove that segment, without removing the entire lobe. This surgery is called a segmentectomy. Compared to a lobectomy, a segmentectomy saves a larger amount of healthy lung tissue.\n\nWith the advances in screening technology for lung cancer tumours, an increasing amount of very small lung cancer tumours are being found, and the demand for segmentectomy is increasing. A segmentectomy is a hard surgery to perform robotically because it is difficult to view the tissue lines that separate each segment within the lobe. As a result, it is difficult for the surgeon to see exactly which pieces of tissue should be removed. Because of these challenges, many patients having robotic surgery will have a lobectomy, even if a full lobectomy is not needed.\n\nNear-Infrared Fluorescence (NIF) using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dye is a recent advancement in the robotic platform of robotic surgery. The surgeon will view the CT scan to determine which segment the tumour is located in. Once identified, the surgeon will isolate the segment by cutting off the blood supply to that segment. Then ICG will be injected into a vein. It is expected that the entire lung, except the isolated segment, which will remain 'dark' as it was isolated from blood supply, will fluoresce, giving off a green hue when viewed with the da Vinci Firefly camera. The surgeon will identify 'dark' segment, and will remove it. A pathologist will examine the excised tissue to ensure that the tumour was removed in its entirety. Once confirmed, the surgeon will end the procedure. If the pathologist determines that the segment removed did not contain the entire tumour, then the surgeon will perform a routine lobectomy. This ensures patient safety and confirms that all participants will have the entire tumour removed from their lung.",

    "detailed_description": "Epidemiological studies describe a statistically significant correlation between hospitalization rate and exposure to environmental pollutants such as atmospheric particulates (PM10 and PM2.5). The harmfulness to human health depends on both the chemical composition and the particle size. Chronic exposure to particulate matter contributes to the risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as may increase the risk of lung cancer. In fact, particulate matter is universally recognized as a Class 1 carcinogen. The fine particulates are harmful for human health by the ability to carry other pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the lungs. Notably, the PAHs cause lung damage due to their ability to induce the release of inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress. These events result in remodeling and destruction of the alveolar parenchyma, both involved in respiratory disease onset and progression such as asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. Therefore, the involvement of environmental pollutants in the predisposition and exacerbation of lung diseases, in the development of respiratory infections and in the process of carcinogenesis is evident. Moreover, in addition, oxidative stress associated with environmental pollutants could induce DNA damage. Recently, unconventional DNA structures have been identified, recognized as G-quadruplex (G4), which are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. In fact, it is known that guanine-rich DNA sequences are more reactive with hydroxyl radicals than guanine residues scattered throughout the genome, and that oxidative damage (8-oxo-dg) formation at the G4 level reduces its thermal stability. Given the role of G4 in physiological and pathological processes and their presence in mitochondrial DNA, telomeres and proto-promoters oncogenes, it is interesting to investigate the potential involvement in cellular mechanisms of response to oxidative stress associated with pollutants. It is known that pollutant-induced oxidative stress has the ability to alter mitochondrial integrity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence points to innate immunity, apoptosis, and metabolism being largely regulated by mitochondrial activities. In turn, normal mitochondrial activity can be affected by inflammatory processes, infections, tobacco smoking and \"environmental insults\" and could respond to such stimuli through structural alterations and protein expression resulting in dysfunction. The mitochondria involvement in the innate and adaptive immune response regulation corroborates the role of pollutants in respiratory diseases pathogenesis. Indeed, mitochondrial function and integrity are critical for both the effector and memory stages of differentiation of T cells which play a primary role in respiratory diseases. In this context, the PD-1/PD-L1 immune check-points are essential in promoting the immune system homeostasis. Indeed, they take part in self-tolerance and consist of a series of ligand-receptor interactions involved in coordinating an effective immune response while limiting collateral damage to organs and tissues. The contribution of our research group in the study of the pathway PD-1/PD-L1 in the context of respiratory diseases was relevant, observing that this pathway is not only altered in lung cancer but also in chronic lung diseases such as COPD. Currently, although the role of environmental pollutants, mitochondrial dysfunction and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in the pathogenesis of many respiratory diseases is recognized, it is useful to further clarify the underlying molecular interconnections and the mechanisms by which pollutants could affect mitochondrial integrity and immune checkpoints.",

Intermediate home self-assessments will also be scheduled for halfway between each annual clinic visit. Upon experiencing cold-like symptoms, participants will be asked to complete a at home self-nasal and throat swab as well as symptom, medication, and lung function home diary cards.\n\nWhat are the possible benefits and risks of participating:\n\nTaking part will not improve participants' health, although participants might benefit from a general health check at Screening as well as additional health checks and assessments of participants' inhaler technique during the conduct of the study.\n\nThere may be unexpected and unforeseen risks related to the study procedures. When attending for clinic visits, assessment will be performed by appropriately trained and qualified staff. Participants will be monitored for any procedure related symptoms such as, pain or bruising at the site where blood is drawn. Discomfort, sneezing, watery eyes, irritated nose, or nose bleeding during nasal sample collection. Light-headedness, dizziness, fatigue, coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, chest discomfort, throat irritation and itching during lung function testing. Skin irritation and allergic reactions from skin prick testing.\n\nShould participants experience any of these symptoms, trained staff will be on hand to provide the appropriate medical treatment.\n\nThe Methacholine bronchial challenge test is also likely to cause asthma symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. In rare cases, the test can cause severe bronchospasm.\n\nAfter the test or if the bronchospasm is severe, the technician will give the participant medication to inhale that will open the airways.\n\nIf the participant experiences any asthma exacerbation as a result of the methacholine test, the exacerbation management guidelines will be used to assess the participant and guide treatment.\n\nOnly participants that are not contraindicated for a methacholine test will have this performed.\n\nFor the at home assessments, participants will receive proper training on how to perform these during screening visit and as needed during each clinic follow-up visit.\n\nAny abnormalities identified during the study will be communicated to the participant, as well as to the participant's GP or a specialist if necessary.\n\nWhere is the study run from:\n\nhVIVO Services Limited - UK.

    "detailed_description": "Cryptococcus is a fungus that causes infections most commonly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS and solid organ transplant recipients, particularly renal transplant recipients (1-3). However, approximately one-third of cases fall outside these groups and, overall, 12.9 percent to 17.9 percent have no readily identifiable immune defect (4, 5). The genetic factors, which may predispose to cryptococcosis and the immune response in these patients, have not been extensively studied.\n\nThis protocol is designed to examine the immune deficits that predispose to cryptococcosis as well as the clinical and immune responses among previously healthy adults. The patients included will have an unknown predisposing condition and cryptococcosis. Patients will undergo various sampling procedures, including saliva, blood, eyebrow hair, CSF, and nail clipping collection. Throughout the study, patients will be provided with standard medical care and will be seen as often as necessary to manage their condition. Patients in whom microbiologic control of the infection has occurred but in whom inflammation is causing neurologic damage may be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Genetically related family members of patients will also be screened for clinical, in vitro, immune, and genetic correlates of immune abnormalities. Healthy adult volunteers, as a comparison group, will be enrolled as a source of blood samples, saliva samples, CSF samples, and eyebrow hair samples for research testing. Moreover, with respect to cryptococcosis, patients with isolated non-central nervous system (CNS) disease (e.g., pulmonary) may serve as a subset comparator to those with CNS involvement-a major tissue tropism for Cryptococcus.\n\nGenetic and immunologic testing will be performed on all subjects (patients, relatives, and healthy volunteers) to evaluate for possible immunogenetic factors that lead to susceptibility to cryptococcosis. Among the aims of this protocol are to better understand the pathophysiology and genetic factors that lead to defects in host defense and to use modern and evolving methods in molecular and cellular biology to elucidate the pathogenesis of this particular susceptibility. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of immune defects and genetic susceptibility to fungal infections could allow for the rational development of novel therapies for such diseases and to benefit future patients.",

BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule (DLL3/CD3 bispecific) that may help the immune system fight cancer. In this study, BI 764532 is given to people for the first time. That means no clinical data are available for BI 764532.\n\nParticipants get BI 764532 either weekly or once every 3 weeks. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for a maximum of 3 years. During this time, participants visit the study site about 20 times depending on the response to the treatment. Doctors record any unwanted effects and regularly check the general health of the participants.",

    "detailed_description": "This study is a single-center, prospective, observational cohort study. The design and implementation of the whole study were carried out according to the CONSORT principle. The study was conducted at the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and patients were followed up for 28 days.\n\nPostoperative patients with colorectal cancer who met the criteria were included. All patients were initiated with low molecular weight heparin (nardraparin calcium injection) for drug prophylaxis after surgery. In clinical practice, patients who underwent surgery at different times on the same day received prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin at 24h after surgery, forming two cohorts of early initiation (within 24 hours after surgery) and late initiation (beyond 24 hours after surgery). According to the previous clinical data survey in the past year, since the number of operating tables and the end time of surgery are relatively fixed every day, the number of people in each group of early start and late start groups is about 300 per group per year according to the end time of surgery, which basically conforms to the ratio of 1:1.\n\nThe dose of low molecular weight heparin (Nardrheparin calcium injection) was 100AxaIU/kg, adjusted according to the patient's body weight, and was administered subcutaneously once a day throughout the patient's hospital stay. All patients underwent color Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs before discharge (7-10 days after surgery) and 28 days after surgery, including screening for thrombus in the proximal deep vein (femoral vein, popliteal vein), distal deep vein (posterior tibial vein, peroneal vein and muscular vein) and venous communication branch. Each enrolled patient will be followed up for 28 days, and all patients will be followed up 28 days after surgery. If the patient is unable to return to the hospital at the scheduled follow-up time point, the patient can be reminded by phone to be admitted for follow-up visit.",

    "detailed_description": "Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world. Surgical treatment is the first and most important treatment for lung cancer. It can completely remove the primary lesions of lung cancer and metastasis of lymph nodes to achieve clinical cure. Opening the chest into the chest allows for an excellent surgical field of view, but it is usually necessary to divide the pectoralis and separate the ribs. To prevent these shortcomings, in the early 1990s, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was first applied to anatomical pneumonectomy and proved to be safe and feasible. Nowadays, for patients with stage I lung cancer, the NCCN guidelines point out that if the patient has no contraindications for anatomy and surgery, as long as it does not violate the standard of tumor treatment and the principle of thoracic surgery, it is highly recommended of VATS or minimally invasive surgery.\n\nFor lung cancer, the benefit of VATS over open surgery is mainly due to the reduction of surgical trauma and the relative maintenance of chest integrity, the reduction of immune function, the reduction of postoperative pain, and the preservation of lung and shoulder function. What's more, the incidence of postoperative complications is reduced, patients recover faster, hospitalization is short, and normal activities are restored early. Although previous papers seem to have obvious advantages, there is a lack of clinical prospective data from patients with stage II-III lung cancer, and especially in the prevalence of uniportal VATS, there is still no objective analysis of this hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized, prospective study to compare perioperative complications, postoperative pain, life quality, lung function recovery, tumor-free survival rate, etc., in lobectomy for stage II-III lung cancer patients with VATS and thoracotomy. the investigators would complete the real and effective accumulation of data through strict enrollment, detailed records, and regular follow-up, in order to provide suggestions for the development of new guidelines.",

Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

    "brief_summary": "The emergence of tumor organoid cultures in recent years has made it possible to widen the repertoire of available preclinical tumor models and to bridge the gap between cell lines and tumors of xenografted patients in mice (PDXs).These organoids have the advantages of being able to be amplified fairly quickly after resection of the tumor, of having unlimited proliferation potential, a high rate of establishment success, and the possibility of being transfected and cryopreserved. These characteristics therefore allow them to summarize the clinical spectra of cancers, but also to be models for studying tumor progression as has been done with organoids for colorectal cancer. They are also very close morphologically and genetically to the tumor from which they derive.Finally, clinical trials are underway to determine whether the organoids of mammary, pulmonary and colorectal cancers can predict the response to patients' treatments and guide the therapeutic decision.It would therefore be possible to test multiple treatments on different samples. This would allow screening of a panel of treatments on a given tumor type but also to test a treatment ex vivo before administering it to the patient in vivo. This prospect is very interesting in particular in the tumors of the VADS where more than two thirds of the operated patients will benefit from a complementary treatment by radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy whose consequences can be important. Despite this adjuvant management, up to 30% of patients will relapse, highlighting a variable tumor chemosensitivity. This screening could make it possible to refine the choice of treatments adapted to each patient and thus limit the undesirable effects.The feasibility of establishing head and neck squamous cell organoid lines seems encouraging, with organoids derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and oropharynx having been recently established.",

    "brief_summary": "Previous studies in Western country show that triple-negative breast cancer has aggressive clinical and pathological features compared with non-triple negative breast cancer, including onset at a young age, advanced clinical stage, high histologic and nuclear grade and more distant recurrence.\n\nAccording to the characteristics of triple negative breast tumor, the TNBC patients can benefit neither from hormonal therapies nor from target therapies against Her2 receptors. The only systemic therapy currently available is chemotherapy, and prognosis remains poor. It becomes more and more important to investigate the sensitive chemotherapy regimen for triple negative patients.\n\nCisplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer, colorectal cancer and ect. Triple negative breast cancer patients were more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies.\n\nThe investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin is more sensitive to triple negative breast cancer compared with CEF followed by docetaxel.",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest and safest dose of the experimental drug veliparib when combined with nivolumab. We will also study how safely this combination of medication can be given in advanced cancer and lymphoma and benefits of receiving this therapy. Nivolumab is currently approved in certain cancers such as melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancer. Veliparib is not yet approved for use in the United States, and is considered experimental. Veliparib inhibits (blocks) the activity of the enzyme PARP. This blocking activity may prevent the cancer cell from repairing itself and resume growing. Nivolumab increases T cells in your immune system, which allows your immune system to attack the cancer. We think the combination of these drugs will be more effective against your cancer.",

Patients must be at least 28 days since any prior radiation or major surgery.\n\nAge greater than 18 years (males or non-pregnant females). Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of BAY 43-9006 in patients less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.\n\nLife expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than 2 (Karnofsky \\> 60%).\n\nPatients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below). Patients must have returned to base line or grade one from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy.\n\nLeukocytes greater than 3,000/micro l;\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count greater than 1,200/micro l;\n\nPlatelets greater than 100,000/micro l;\n\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) less than or equal to 1.2\n\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT) less than or equal to 36 seconds or abnormality can be explained by the presences of lupus anticoagulant\n\nTotal bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal;\n\nAspartate aminotransferase, oxaloacetic transaminase (AST,SGOT) and alanine transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT,SGPT) less than 2.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal;\n\nCreatinine or creatinine clearance less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limits of normal or greater than 45 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.\n\nThe effects of BAY 43-9006 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because kinase inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and continue for at least 2 months after completion. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BAY 43-9006, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BAY 43-9006.\n\nAbility to comply with daily oral self administration schedule, and the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPatients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n\nUncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006. HIV positive patients not receiving antiretroviral therapy are excluded due to the possibility that BAY 43-9006 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to BAY 43-9006.\n\nPatients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n\nHistory of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers will be allowed.\n\nPatients with conditions that would impair their ability to swallow tablets are excluded.\n\nPatients must not have any evidence of bleeding diathesis.\n\nPatients must not be on therapeutic anticoagulation.

    "brief_summary": "This study will investigate the effects and side effects of BAY 43-9006 in patients with advanced, recurrent, or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BAY 43-9006 is one of a new class of anticancer agents known as bi-aryl ureas.\n\nPatients 18 years of age and older with NSCLC that has recurred or progressed after one regimen of chemotherapy may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination; blood tests; tumor biopsy (see below); chest x-ray; electrocardiogram; and imaging studies, including positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT, see below) and dynamic, contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI, see below).\n\nParticipants take BAY 43-9006 by mouth twice a day, morning and evening. On the first and 15th days of treatment, patients are admitted to the hospital for pharmacokinetic studies; that is, a test of how the body handles the drug. For the test, blood is collected at intervals (at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after ingestion) to determine the drug's level in the bloodstream. Treatment with BAY 43-9006 continues until the study doctor determines that the medication is not beneficial or the patient wishes to withdraw from the study.\n\nIn addition to drug therapy, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:\n\n* Physical examination every 4 weeks\n* Blood pressure checks once a week during the first 4 weeks\n* Blood tests every week\n* CT scans or other imaging tests, such as ultrasound or MRI, every 8 weeks to evaluate the tumor's response to treatment. CT is an x-ray test that provides detailed pictures of the inside of the body. It can be done from different angles, providing a 3-dimensional picture of the part of the body being studied and allowing the doctor to see the location, nature, and extent of disease. MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves instead of x-rays to produce accurate, detailed pictures of organs and tissues.\n* PET-CT approximately every 8 weeks to look at how different parts of the body take up and use glucose (a sugar nutrient). Because rapidly growing cells, such as tumors, use more sugar than normal cells do, this test can be used to detect cancer. For the test, the patient is given an injection of a sugar solution in which a radioactive tracer has been attached to the sugar molecule. A special camera detects the radiation emitted by the solution, and the resulting images show how much sugar is being used in various parts of the body. PET-CT uses the PET scan in combination with standard CT in a machine that does both tests.\n* DCE-MRI after 2 weeks of treatment. This test uses MRI with a special non-radioactive dye to examine blood flow in a certain part of the body.\n* Tumor biopsy (optional) after 2 weeks of treatment. A biopsy is the surgical removal of a small piece of tissue. The tumor biopsy is done either using a small bore needle under CT guidance or by direct visualization using a laparoscope/thoracoscope. For the needle biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin and guided by CT into the tumor mass. For the laparoscopy/thoracoscopy, the patient is sedated or asleep and small lighted tubes are inserted into small holes made in the skin. The tumor is located and tissue withdrawn.",
    "detailed_description": "Despite advances in systemic chemotherapy, patients with stage IV NSCLC will die from their disease. The median survival of all patients is 8-16 months, with a one year-survival rate of 33%. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment of advanced disease. Based on available data from randomized trials, current treatment recommendations are to treat with one of several effective cisplatin-doublets which have resulted in median survival of 16 to 18 months. Second line chemotherapy is able to improve outcome in patients who have had prior cisplatin therapy. Although these important milestones represent improvements in the care of patients with metastatic NSCLC, outcome has not been able to be further improved by substituting one active drug for another in a platinum-based doublet, treating patients with more than four cycles of chemotherapy or by using cisplatin-based triplets. It is clear that if we are to improve outcome of NSCLC patients, we will need to develop drugs with novel mechanisms of action that perhaps will inhibit major cellular signaling pathways affecting survival, proliferation and angiogenesis. One new compound, BAY 43-9006, was designed to inhibit Raf and is also known to inhibit other kinases including VEGFR2, VEGFR3, PDGFR-beta, Flt3, c-KIT, and p38(1). BAY 43-9006 has shown in vitro activity against NSCLC cell lines NCI-H460 and A549 with tumor growth inhibition of 27% to 68%. In addition, BAY 43-9006 has shown activity in the H460 NSCLC xenograft model. In NSCLC, the proliferation signaling of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is increased due to the frequent (30%) presence of K-ras mutations in the tumor. Mutations in K-ras have been associated with malignant transformation of normal epithelium and constitutive activation of p21 and its downstream effects on cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Clinical observations have shown that tumors with K-ras mutations tended to be smaller but more poorly differentiated, and associated with a significantly worse three-year mortality rate. As mentioned above, other pathways significant to the malignant potential of NSCLC, particularly those involved in angiogenesis, may also be affected by BAY 43-9006. The in vitro and in vivo data support the clinical investigation of BAY 43-9006 as an inhibitor of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK downstream proliferation effects. The goal of this phase II trial is to determinate if BAY 43-9006 is active in NSCLC, and to measure the BAY 43-9006 biological effects on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To achieve these goals, patients with relapsed or recurrent NSCLC will be given BAY 43-9006 (four weeks cycle of 400mg PO BID). A series of correlative studies will be done during treatment to measure biological and clinical effects of BAY 43-9006. These studies will include analyses of tissue and blood samples as well as correlative imaging studies.",

Patients will be administered oral Vorinostat and radiation therapy and will be treated for 3 weeks. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts and will be treated at sequentially rising dose levels of Vorinostat combined with radiation therapy. We will initially enter 3 subjects at each dose. If none of the three experiences a dose-limiting toxicity we will proceed to the next dose. If one of the three experiences that level of toxicity, we will accrue 3 more subjects at that dose. If at any time there are two or more dose-limiting toxicities (in the 3-6 subjects) on a given dose, we will drop down to a lower dose. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD of Vorinostat and radiation therapy is established. The MTD will then be one dose below the DLT occurring in at least 1 out of 3 subjects (2 out of 6 patients).",
    "detailed_description": "In recent years, a number of investigators have shown that combining signal transduction agents with ionizing radiation results in significant antitumor effects without an increase in normal tissue toxicity. There are numerous lines of evidence that Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo 1-6. Vorinostat (Zolinza, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid - SAHA) a potent histone deacetylase, has recently been approved for clinical use for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It has the potential to inhibit tumor growth and proliferation7-13, tumor angiogenesis14 and enhance radiation response15 with minimal toxicity. This phase I study, is based on the range of efficacy of Vorinostat and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. This study will evaluate the safety of combination of Vorinostat and daily-fractionated radiation therapy. This information is critical for any combined future combined modality trials that involves radiation therapy to the brain.\n\nVorinostat was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 6-Oct-2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.\n\nBased on preclinical, clinical efficacy and safety data, it is anticipated that Vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy can be administered safely and will be tolerated in patients with brain metastases. In addition, within the recognized limits of a Phase I clinical trial, this study may provide an assessment of the anti-tumor activity of Vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases.\n\nThe present study will investigate the safety, tolerability and spectrum of side effects of Vorinostat in combination with radiation therapy. As such, this study will characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of in combination with radiation therapy in patients with brain metastases.",

However, clinical courses vary widely and eventual treatment failure is inevitable. The most common resistance mechanism against first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors is the EGFR T790M mutation, which emerges in about 50% of cases and is amenable to next-line treatment with the third-generation compound osimertinib. However, experience in everyday clinical practice shows that implementation of EGFR TKI sequencing is often problematic, for example because a considerable number of EGFR+ NSCLC patients failing first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors do not undergo T790M mutation testing at the time of disease progression. This study will use patient records to analyze the clinical course of EGFR+ NSCLC patients treated with first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors at the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg (Germany) during the past years. The main aim is to analyze the diagnostic and therapeutic measures, including implementation of osimertinib, taken at the time of disease progression as well as their effect on patient outcome in a real-world, routine clinical setting.",

We also intend to detect any correlation between heparanase blood and urine levels and the Pharmacokinetics of LMWH.",
    "detailed_description": "Scientific background. The increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer has long been recognized (1). Since first described by Trousseau in 1865, many aspects of this complex relationship are still obscure (2). Cancer patients have an increased risk for developing thrombosis. Similarly, patients presenting with idiopathic VTE are considered to have a higher risk of developing cancer (3). Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic VTE harbor an underlying malignancy that can be detected by an extensive diagnostic work-up (4). Clinical data indicate that cancer alone is associated with a 4.1- fold risk of thrombosis, and chemotherapy increases the risk to 6.1- folds (5). Cancer patients develop postoperative VTE at least 2- folds more than patients without cancer undergoing the same surgical procedure (6). Treatment of VTE involves the administration of heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or coumarin derivatives. Beside its anticoagulant effects, LMWH may also have an anti-tumoral effect (7-12). The use of LMWH relative to coumarin derivatives was associated with improved survival in patients with solid tumors who did not have metastatic disease at the time of an acute VTE (9). Moreover, addition of LMWH to chemotherapy increased survival of patients with small cell lung cancer (10).\n\nHeparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are ubiquitous macromolecules associated with the cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) of a wide range of cells of vertebrate and invertebrate tissues. Heparin is structurally related to heparan sulfate (HS), but has higher N- and O-sulfate contents (13). Mammalian endoglycosidase, capable of partially depolymerizing HS chains and commonly referred to as heparanase, has been identified in a variety of cell types and tissues, primarily cancer cells, activated cells of the immune system, platelets, and placenta (14-17). Heparanase is synthesized as a latent 65 kDa precursor whose activation involves proteolytic cleavage at two potential sites located at the N-terminal region of the molecule (Glu109 -Ser110 and Gln157 -lys158), resulting in the formation of two protein subunits that heterodimerize and form the active heparanase enzyme (18). Expression of heparanase correlates with the metastatic potential of human tumor cells (14-16, 19). Furthermore, elevated levels of heparanase were detected in the urine of some patients with aggressive metastatic disease (20). Heparin, LMWH, non-anticoagulant and chemically modified species of heparin (21, 22), as well as other polysaccharides (23, 24) which inhibit experimental metastasis, also inhibit tumor cell heparanase, while other related compounds had a small or no effect on both parameters (21-24). Recently, we demonstrated that the anticoagulant activities of heparin and LMWH can be neutralized by their pre-incubation with heparanase. Transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase, exhibited a hyper-coagulable phenotype expressed by a markedly shorter base-line APTT compared to control mice (25). These results may suggest that resistance to heparin, described in patients with malignancies (26, 27), could be attributed, in part, to high levels of heparanase often observed in cells (28, 29) and body fluids (20) of patients with an aggressive malignant disease. Degradation of heparin and LMWH by heparanase in vivo may be relevant in situations in which heparanase is over-expressed, and treatment with heparin or LMWH is needed (e.g., deep venous thrombosis in patients with pancreatic carcinoma) (29, 30). The pharmacokinetics of LMWH (i.e. the time course of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and degradation) as reflected by its effects upon factor Xa activity, was elucidated in several subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with renal failure, pregnant women\u2026), but to the best of our knowledge was not addressed in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n\nObjectives \\& expected significance. In view of the above described biological significance of the heparanase enzyme, and taking into account our recent in vitro and in vivo results (heparanase capability to cleave heparin and LMWH; and the altered coagulation profile in transgenic mice overexpressing heparanase) (25), we propose to focus on the following specific aims:\n\nI) Measure plasma and urine heparanase levels in patients with advanced cancer suffering from VTE, and compare it to controls without cancer.\n\nII) Elucidate the pharmacokinetics of LMWH in patients with advanced solid tumors (AST) suffering from VTE, and compare it to the pharmacokinetics of LMWH in patients with unstable angina pectoris.\n\nIII) Determine the correlation between heparanase blood levels and the pharmacokinetics of LMWH, if any.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "brief_summary": "Background: Evidence supports exercise and nutrition as beneficial for enhancing QOL in earlier stages of lung cancer; however, there is minimal research of either intervention - and none with combined interventions - in advanced lung cancer patients. In addition to a multimodal intervention approach that includes nutrition and exercise, consideration of advanced cancer care symptom management is crucial for optimizing the potential benefits of either intervention.\n\nObjectives: Primary outcome measure of this study is feasibility, including recruitment (% who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion, safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from one-on-one participant interviews. The secondary outcome to be measured is the impact of the intervention on PROs, including QOL, fatigue and symptom burden, as well as self-reported physical activity levels and physical function assessed in-person.\n\nMethods: The proposed exercise intervention will include a centre-based group exercise program plus home-based exercises, and behaviour change support for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, classified as stage III or IV with self-reported symptom burden. Eligible participants must be cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA). Using a prospective, mixed-methods design (supported by the Medical Research Council guidance for the evaluation of complex interventions), the quantitative component of this pilot study will measure feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, with an embedded qualitative component to examine participant perspectives about study tolerability/feasibility of the intervention. A subset of participants and instructors will be recruited for qualitative interviews using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lung cancer type/stage, treatment).\n\nRelevance: The proposed work will inform the design of a future pragmatic trial for this population. The goal is to build a patient-focused model of care that delivers wellness resources for advanced lung cancer care that will ultimately improve the patients' health and QOL. This approach is novel, patient-focused, and will build a tailored approach within existing resources to deliver optimal care.",
    "detailed_description": "Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada, and is the leading cause of death from cancer.1 Despite this, long-term survival rates for lung cancer are improving, owing largely to recent advances in treatment. The progression of symptoms of advanced lung cancer often exacerbate the emotional and psychological distress experienced by patients and families, which contributes to sedentary behaviour as well as diminished QOL.2 In addition, the toxicities of traditional chemotherapies, such as the reduction of lean muscle mass3,4,5, are not adequately addressed in current research or used in clinical practice. The proposed work will thus assess the feasibility and patient impact of an integrated multimodal intervention for advanced (stage III and IV) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), inclusive of tailored exercise programming, nutrition counselling, and behaviour change support, in addition to palliative symptom management.\n\nEvidence shows that physical function and physical independence are among the most important determinants of QOL for cancer patients with palliative care needs.6 There is strong empirical evidence to demonstrate the positive impact of each individual modality included in the proposed intervention - symptom management, nutrition, and exercise - on QOL in advanced cancer populations, including patients with metastatic NSCLC.7,8 Nutritional status has been shown to be predictive of QOL in patients with cancer, including in those diagnosed with inoperable NSCLC.9 Exercise is also supported as beneficial for overall QOL in advanced cancer populations, with particularly strong effects on physical and mental well-being.10 Exercise promotes the retention and utilization of nutrients and anabolism, while palliative symptom measures can help improve oral intake by ameliorating symptoms such as nausea, mucositis, thrush or constipation.11 Palliative symptom measures may also help reduce obstacles to exercise, such as pain or dyspnea, that are commonly experienced by patients with advanced lung cancer. Despite the promising evidence, few studies have examined the effect of combining a nutrition and exercise intervention within palliative care, yet preliminary data suggests synergistic effects. Results from a recent randomized control trial suggest that an intervention combining nutrition and exercise components may be feasible in advanced cancer care (including stage IV NSCLC care), with an attrition rate of only 86% during the 3-month trial period. 12 While this is promising, there is still limited data on the feasibility of these interventions, and there have been no RCTs to date that have combined palliative care with nutrition and exercise interventions (Hall CC, Cook J, Maddocks M et al. Combined exercise and nutritional rehabilitation in outpatients with incurable cancer: a systematic review. Support Care Cancer 2019; 27:2371-2384) .13,14\n\nGiven the growing number of NSCLC patients entering long-term survivorship, this work is critical for ensuring that the healthcare system is addressing their unique supportive and palliative care needs. Our project is relevant to the present funding opportunity because of its focus on patient reported outcomes (PROs). We will utilize PROs that are used in AHS (\"Putting Patients First\") and in the cancer population (FACT-G, FACT-lung, and FACIT-F), and will collect patient feedback (qualitative interviews) on the intervention recruitment and delivery. This work will also help connect existing palliative resources at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Complex Cancer Care team, physiatry, and nutrition), along with ongoing work on the University of Calgary's Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE) program.15 The preliminary outcome and feasibility data will inform the sample size and characteristics for a future PCT. By showing proof of concept in advanced lung cancer, a disease with high patient burden, we hope results from this work will facilitate further adaptation of the proposed multimodal intervention to support the palliative care needs of other tumour groups.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThis pilot study will examine a multimodal intervention, including exercise and nutrition in conjunction with palliative symptom management, on the QOL of advanced NSCLC patients. The impact of symptom burden on the QOL in NSCLC patients is significant and under-recognized. Due to improvements in therapies, there is an opportunity to address QOL in this population, whose members are now, on average, living longer and potentially more able to engage in rehabilitation interventions. This work will address a gap in research and clinical practice by providing initial data that to examine delivery of supportive and palliative cancer care to the advanced NSCLC population and provide a starting point for tailoring interventions in other tumour groups. Given the novel nature of this research, both in terms of the multimodal intervention as well as the focus on an underserved population, the primary objective is to assess the feasibility of the intervention. Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary data on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of QOL (FACT-G and FACT-lung), and patient functioning measures (symptom measurement, Putting Patients First assessment tool, exercise levels, and fitness outcomes).\n\nMethodology:\n\nThis pilot study will involve a prospective, mixed-methods design. The quantitative component includes measures of study feasibility and exploratory outcome measures, as described below. The embedded qualitative component will use semi-structured one-on-one interviews to explore participant perspectives about intervention tolerability/feasibility, with a focus on barriers and facilitators to participation, perspectives on recruitment, the type and combination of intervention modalities (exercise type, role of instructor, and content within the palliative symptom and nutrition intervention), delivery locations, duration of the intervention and satisfaction with the outcome measures used. The rationale for this study design follows the Medical Research Council guidelines for the evaluation of complex interventions16,17 which supports the use of qualitative methods nested within a larger trial to understand the \"active ingredients\" and contextual factors that result in certain outcomes in a complex intervention study. This has been used as a framework for previously published complex intervention trials in palliative care.18, 19 Research Team: Co-Principal Investigators (Culos-Reed and Abdul-Razzak) will share responsibility for the research project. Dr. Culos-Reed will coordinate the overall project, as well as oversee the exercise component of the intervention. She has 20 years of experience working in cancer and exercise research and brings a strong background in knowledge translation to the proposed work. Dr. Culos-Reed will also provide in-kind support through use of her research facility (Health and Wellness Lab) at the University of Calgary, as well as support from current graduate students and staff (CEP, CPTs and research coordinators) affiliated with her lab. Dr. Abdul-Razzak will oversee the clinical implementation of the project at the TBCC, including support of participant recruitment and delivery of the care by the intervention teams. She has extensive training in qualitative methodology and in clinical trials research in the palliative population. Several co-applicants and collaborators have been instrumental in the conceptualization of this project, and bring extensive clinical expertise in oncology (Bebb), cancer physiatry and rehabilitation (Francis, Capozzi) and nutrition therapy for patients with advanced cancer (Dexter, Gillis, Walker, Black). This multidisciplinary team will continue to be involved in the pilot study design and delivery, as well as subsequent work on the PCT.\n\nStudy Participants: Advanced NSCLCA patients, classified as stage III or IV, with self-reported symptom burden, and cleared by the health care professionals (HCP) to engage in mild to moderate levels of physical activity (PA).\n\nWe will recruit n=10-15, and based on current patient numbers, this is a conservative expectation for the 6 month recruitment period.\n\nA subset of participants will be invited to participate in one-on-one qualitative interviews with the aim of understanding their perspectives on engaging in the study, including barriers and facilitators to participation and the impact of the interventions of quality of life and symptom control. A thematic analysis approach will be utilized, and although an exact a priori sample size cannot be calculated, we estimate that 5-10 interviews may be required in order to achieve an adequate understanding of patient perspectives (i.e., data saturation). We will use a maximum variation sampling strategy based on age, gender, functional status and cancer treatments. All participants will be offered interviews, if they consented to be contacted, and sampling will occur until adequate understanding at each timepoint is achieved via the patient perspective.\n\nIntervention Components:\n\n1. Exercise: The proposed exercise intervention (under the direction of Drs. Capozzi, Culos-Reed and Francis) will include a centre-based group exercise program plus home-based exercises, along with behaviour change support. The interventionist will be a CEP who will receive prior training on the health behaviour change support, similar to that currently used within the ACE program.15 The 12-week group-based exercise program, consisting of 1 weekly 75 minute session, of which 45 minutes are exercise and 15 minutes of yoga, and the other 15 minutes includes education and facilitating the group social support, will be delivered in dedicated fitness facilities located at the Holy Cross Hospital in Calgary and at the University of Calgary. Forty-five minute exercise circuits will include 6 exercise stations, with modifications made according to the baseline physical function of each participant. The exercise circuit will be followed by a 15-minute therapeutic yoga class, based on Dr. Culos-Reed's Yoga Thrive program.20-22 Overall, the 60 minute session will include a light warm up (5-10 minutes), and 6 exercise stations with a range of functional exercises designed to target both aerobic and strength components of fitness (35-40 minutes), with modifications made according to physical function at the start of the program. The main focus of the circuit will be on muscle strength, balance, flexibility and aerobic capacity as associated with beneficial daily physical function (i.e., for activities of daily living). Most group sessions will involve a series of circuit-style classes, that allow for adequate group supervision as well as the ability for individuals to work at their own pace. In addition to the weekly group-based class, a home-based exercise prescription for an additional 1-2 sessions per week, facilitated by provision of basic home-based fitness equipment and the Yoga Thrive class videos, will be provided. A FitBit will also be provided for the duration of the study to support physical activity behavior change and enhance safety, and returned upon completion of the exercise program. To reduce burden, participants will not be required to report objective physical activity from the device.\n2. Palliative Symptom Management: Palliative symptom management (under the direction of Drs. Abdul-Razzak and Bebb, and Dr. Lyle Galloway) will focus on symptoms that contribute to reduced QOL (e.g. pain, fatigue, nausea), limit one's ability to engage in exercise, or present barriers to oral intake (e.g., pain management, nausea, mucositis, thrush). These will be delivered by the Complex Cancer Care Management team at the TBCC, which includes a team of physicians, a nurse practitioner, advanced practice pharmacists and a nurse coordinator. Clinicians will deliver pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies based on their clinical judgement. Participant assessments will occur in conjunction with scheduled lung cancer clinic visits, cancer therapy treatment visits, or as separate dedicated research visits when necessary. The initial assessment will occur within two weeks of the exercise program initiation. After the initial assessment, follow-up consultations can occur at the discretion of the palliative care clinicians and participants and may occur either in person or by phone. Clinical case report forms will be used to track the type of treatments provided during these visits for descriptive purposes.\n3. Nutrition: The nutrition component of the intervention is designed to meet individual nutrient needs and lifestyle of participants, as well as work synergistically with the previously described exercise component. The study coordinator will ask participants to complete a self-administered online 24-hr dietary food recall. Participants will be asked to record one weekday and one weekend day. The Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24\u00ae) dietary assessment tool was created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and is a free web-based tool that enables multiple, automatically coded, self-administered 24-hour recalls (http://asa24.ca/ ). Participants will be provided with instructions on how to use this technology. Chelsia Gillis (PhD Candidate, RD on the research team) will consult with the TBCC Registered Dietitian (RD) team to develop a relevant feedback form and tailored nutrition advice based on a pre-study food recall evaluation (\"what do you typically eat in a day?\").This evaluation will assess micro- and macronutrient intake, as well as individual client needs. Data from this evaluation will be analyzed and managed under the leadership of Gillis, who will also direct TBCC staff nutritionist on the nutrition intervention delivery within 2 weeks of study enrollment. RDs involved in the study will also have the ability to recommend interventions based on the nutrition assessment feedback form, such as oral nutritional supplementation or target daily protein and caloric intake. The number of follow-up dietitian visits will be determined based on individual need for each participant, and post-study food recall evaluation data will be collected and analyzed by Gillis (with support from appropriate members of the research team) to assess changes in food intake behaviours, and possible correlations to levels of exercise participation and patient-reported outcomes.\n\nData Collection: We will collect demographic data and details of tumour type (e.g., histology, biomarkers) and treatments received prior to and during the trial (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy). Primary outcome measures will assess study feasibility both quantitatively and qualitatively, including recruitment (% who participate from those eligible), attendance (weekly group class), assessment completion, safety (adverse event reporting), attrition rates, and qualitative themes generated from one-on-one participant interviews (conducted at the end of the intervention). We will recruit a subset of participants for the interviews, using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation based on factors that may lead to different viewpoints (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle factors, cancer stage, treatment). It is hypothesized that a weekly group-based PA intervention will be feasible for advanced NSCLC patients, (predicted as 30% recruitment of patients approached for participation and 60% attendance at weekly group class and 70% assessment completion), and safe (zero reported adverse events related to the exercise intervention).\n\nSecondary outcomes include exploratory analysis of the intervention's impact on PROs, including QOL, including fatigue and symptom burden. QOL will be measured with the FACT-general and FACT-lung, and fatigue will be measured with the FACIT-fatigue. The symptom burden inventory (ESAS) that is part of the Putting Patients First (PPF) assessment is collected for all patients at TBCC and will be collected from chart review. It will also be collected before and after each exercise session. Nutrition will be assessed from the food recall evaluation data collected pre and post intervention. Physical performance (modified senior's fitness test: resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, height, weight, waist/hip circumference, sit-and-reach, shoulder range of motion, 30-second sit to stand, handgrip strength, 6-minute walk test, single-leg balance), activity levels (self-reported, Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire) and opioid/other drug use (chart review) will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention.\n\nPRO measures will be collected through questionnaires administered at baseline (pre-intervention) and post-intervention and completed either online (survey monkey) or in person during the clinic or exercise assessment using a hard copy of the online survey. Exercise assessments will be completed at the Health and Wellness Lab (Culos-Reed) by a CEP not involved in the delivery of the exercise intervention. Relevant medical or symptom management information will be obtained from chart review and from the case report forms collected over the duration of the 12-week intervention, and stored in a secure offline database. To reduce burden in this feasibility study, participants will not be required to report objective physical activity from the device.\n\nAnalysis: Quantitative analysis will include descriptive statistics (means/medians, standard deviations) and dependent t-tests to measure change over time within the participants. The qualitative analysis of the interviews will include verbatim transcription and input into NVivo for thematic analysis. Results of both data sources analyses will be examined to provide a richer understanding of the feasibility and tolerability of the described multimodal intervention in the advanced NSCLC population.\n\nThe proposed work will inform the feasibility of providing a multimodal complex care intervention to promote QOL in advanced NSCLC patients. Specifically, by evaluating feasibility of this intervention, we aim to develop a larger trial (PCT) aimed at measuring the impact of a multimodal cancer rehabilitation service on QOL in numerous advanced tumour group populations.",

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.

It is not yet known if chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone before surgery in treating non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel and cisplatin with or without radiation therapy to see how well they work when given before surgery in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to lymph nodes in the chest.",

Arm II: T cell depletion is conducted by 2 different methods, according to the institution, and treatment varies depending on the method used. Method I is by T10B9 depletion and Method II is by counterflow elutriation depletion. Method I: Depending on the institution, some patients receive TBI on days -9 to -7 (before chemotherapy) (Course I) and some receive TBI on days -3 to -1 (after chemotherapy) (Course II). Course I also includes cytarabine IV on days -5 to -3, cyclophosphamide IV on days -2 and -1, and methylprednisolone IV on days -2 to 0 and 5-18. Bone marrow infusion is administered on day 0. Cyclosporine begins on day -1. Course II includes cytarabine IV on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide on days -6 to -5. Methylprednisolone IV is administered on days -2 to 0 and 5-18. Bone marrow infusion is administered on day 0. Cyclosporine begins on day 0. Method II: Preparative therapy varies according to the disease category. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Patients undergo TBI on days -7 to -4. Males receive testicular boost on day -7, and all receive electron boost to anterior and posterior chest wall on days -5 and -4. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on days -3 and -2. Bone marrow infusion is administered on day 0. Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6, followed by TBI on days -4 to -1.

Specifically, a subsequent analysis of the Hokusai study showed that the excess in MB was confined to patients with gastrointestinal cancer. In the RIETE registry, patients with gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers experienced more bleeding outcomes while patients with brain or lung cancer experienced more thrombotic outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of the Caravaggio trial, major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with CRC was low and similar in both apixaban and LMWH groups. Patients with CRC are underrepresented in the major trials examining treatment of CAT with anticoagulant. Despite concerns that DOACs pose a significant bleeding risk in CRC patients, many patients with CRC are treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban in clinical practice. Balancing risks of thrombosis recurrence and bleeding can be challenging and requires a nuanced, individualized approach to decision making to improve prognosis in this population.

In our secondary aims, we will determine whether high intensity exercise improves six-minute walk distance as compared to the attention control group. In secondary aims, we will also determine whether low intensity exercise and high intensity home-based exercise, respectively, improve patient reported outcomes, physical activity, and treadmill walking performance compared to attention control. Our intervention directly addresses two aspects of current practice guidelines that are major barriers to exercise for patients with PAD: 1) the recommendation for supervised exercise and 2) the recommendation for high intensity ischemic-pain inducing walking exercise.",

The low and high intensity exercise groups will attend center-based exercise sessions once per week for four weeks followed by transition to an entirely home-based exercise program for an additional 48 weeks (52 weeks total). Coaches will contact participants weekly by telephone after the first four weeks of the intervention. The low and high intensity exercise interventions will use identical self-regulatory and support strategies. However, the low intensity exercise group will be instructed to exercise with minimal to no ischemic leg discomfort and the high intensity group will be instructed to exercise to maximal ischemic leg pain. These two distinct exercise prescriptions will be reinforced during 48 weeks of home-based exercise, using a well-validated behavioral coaching model that can be delivered by telephone once weekly. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 52-week follow-up. If our hypotheses are correct, millions of people with PAD will benefit from this alternative exercise regimen which will be accessible to most of the 8 million people in the U.S. who suffer from PAD.",

It is also increasingly used to treat lung metastases in patients with oligometastatic disease. While SBRT is a powerful tool for the treatment of lung tumors, access to specialized treatment can be limited for patients who live far away from a treatment center. Geographic accessibility can be limiting even for patients receiving one fraction lung SBRT, as the typical consult, CT simulation, and one-fraction treatment workflow is typically at least two to three weeks from start to finish, with a minimum of three in-person appointments.\n\nIn this study, a high-quality cone beam CT (CBCT) on-board imaging platform (HyperSight; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) will be coupled with advanced motion management and treatment techniques as well as Ethos (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) daily online adaptation to simulation-free workflow for one fraction SBRT. This has the potential to reduce the time it takes a patient to be cured of their lung tumor from two to three weeks to two to three hours. In this novel workflow, patients will undergo telephone/online consent followed by a diagnostic scan-based pre-plan for one fraction SBRT. On the morning of treatment, a brief follow-up appointment will be followed by treatment on the HyperSight/Ethos platform. Patients will be treated using a simulation-free workflow. A HyperSight Thorax Slow protocol CBCT will be acquired for study purposes, and then the patient will be treated with online adaptive CBCT-guided radiotherapy on the Ethos/HyperSight platform. Treatment delivery will take place following contouring and treatment planning. Patients will undergo standard of care simulation imaging in parallel for comparison.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a ONE fraction Simulation-free Treatment with CT-guided stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy for Oligometastatic and Primary lung tumors (ONE STOP) workflow for patients with small, peripheral primary or oligometastatic lung tumors.",

Nearly a decade of clinical trials showed that:the median survival time (MST) of Vinorelbine is 5-10months,1-year survival rate is 32%;the MST of Gemcitabine is 6.8-9months,the MST of Taxol is 6.8-10.3months.Research had shown that TCM can prolong long-term survival and improve QOL, but high-level evidence is desperately needed to support this finding.\n\nThe investigators perform a multi-center, randomized, double-blind controlled, prospective study in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients are randomized over observational group (TCM granules plus single-agent chemotherapy), and control group (TCM placebo plus single-agent chemotherapy). The investigators will observe 4 cycles and after that regular follow-up will be arranged.

The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy has a better efficacy on prolonging PFS, OS, improving QOL, reducing the adverse reaction of patients than that of chemotherapy.Therefore our study can provide evidences for optimizing and promoting integrated TCM combined with Western Medicine treatment.",

In addition, both patients and their loved ones (family and friends) often feel worried or sad about their cancer diagnosis.\n\nResearch has shown that early involvement of a team of clinicians that specialize in lessening (or \"palliating\") many of these distressing physical and emotional symptoms and in helping patients and their family cope with a serious illness improves patients' and their loved ones' experience with their cancer. This team is called \"palliative care,\" and consists of physicians and advanced practice nurses (or \"nurse practitioners\") who work closely and collaboratively with your oncology team to care for the participant and the participant's loved ones. Research shows that when the palliative care team works closely with the oncology team to care for patients with advanced cancer, they may have better symptom control, quality of life, and mood and their loved ones feel less distressed.\n\nThis study will compare two different strategies for scheduling participant's visits with the palliative care clinician. The first strategy is to schedule the participant to meet with the palliative care clinician regularly each month. The investigators call this strategy \"early integrated palliative care\".\n\nThe second strategy is to schedule the participant to meet with the palliative care clinician after the participant is admitted to the hospital or if the participant's oncology team needs to change the participant cancer treatment, as these are times when the participant is likely to have health issues that the palliative care clinician can help with. The investigators will also monitor the participant's quality of life regularly. If the study team determines that the participant quality of life worsens, the investigators will increase the frequency of the participant's visits with the palliative care clinician to monthly appointments. The investigators call this strategy \"stepped palliative care\" because the investigators step up the frequency of the participant palliative care visits if the participant's quality of life worsens during the participant cancer treatment.\n\nNo matter which strategy the participant is taking part in, the participant will still be able to request additional palliative care visits outside of the study schedule if the participant feel they need them.",

    "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is used to treat some kinds of cancer, blood cell disorders, and immune disorders. Stem cells from a donor s blood are used to replace the recipient s stem cells in the bone marrow. The recipient s bone marrow can then produce new blood cells. Some of these new cells involved in the immune system are like the donor s cells. Sometimes immune cells from the SCT attack the recipient s normal tissues, including the eyes. This type of immune attack is called graft-versus-host disease, or GVHD.\n* The symptoms of ocular GVHD include eye pain, irritation, dryness, and inflammation. When it is severe and if it does not respond well to treatment, ocular GVHD may also cause vision loss.\n\nObjective:\n\n\\- To learn more about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the eyes in people who have had stem cell transplantation.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Participants must be at least 18 years of age.\n* They must be taking part in a study at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n* They must have a SCT scheduled within the next 30 days.\n\nDesign:\n\n* The study lasts for 1 year and includes six visits to the National Eye Institute. (There is an optional visit about 1 month before your SCT.) When possible, visits for this study will be scheduled so that they can be done on the same day as your visits for the NCI or NHLBI protocol that you are taking part in.\n* At each visit, participants will have a medical exam and an eye history will be taken. They will have an eye exam and a test to measure the ability to make tears. Those in the study will also have tear fluid collected for analysis in a lab. Tear fluid collection is a painless process. Blood will be drawn during certain visits if it has not already been collected by the transplant team.",
    "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nThe study objectives are to study the development of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in participants treated with stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the NIH, including exam findings prior to SCT, changes in ocular signs and symptoms following SCT and response to standard therapy in participants identified with dry eye and ocular GVHD; to develop clinical outcome measures for early onset and more advanced ocular GVHD and provide estimates of progression rates for these outcomes; to analyze tear fluid, impression cytology (IC) and serum samples from participants undergoing SCT, to identify biomarkers or other findings which may predict the onset of ocular GVHD or correlate with disease progression or response to therapy and to establish a cohort of participants with ocular GVHD in anticipation of future clinical trials.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION:\n\nUp to 50 adult participants undergoing SCT at the NIH, and up to 50 healthy adult participants will be enrolled.\n\nDESIGN:\n\nThis prospective, natural history study will follow participants through 12 months post-SC, with the option to extend follow-up for up to five years.\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\n\nThe primary objective outcome variable is ocular surface staining using fluorescein and lissamine green dyes, as measured by the Oxford criteria, with the scale ranging from 0 to 15 in each eye. The primary subjective outcome measure is the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), ranging from 0 to 100. Secondary outcome variables include best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), tear film osmolarity, Schirmer s tear testing with anesthesia, meibomian gland function and tear break-up time. In addition, tear fluid biomarkers and/or IC will be studied as secondary outcome variables to determine whether changes in biomarker levels (tear fluid) or cell densities and morphologies (IC) correlate with the development or progression of ocular GVHD.",

    "detailed_description": "Interventions\n\nThe multidisciplinary program is composed of 3 elements: exercise, nutritional supplements and psychological coping strategies\n\nExercise program\n\nPatients will be seen by a kinesiologist for a period of 1 hour and he/she will assess patients' mobility and capacity to undertake exercise, will prepare a personalized program and will explain and monitor the exercise program. Patients will be instructed on how to conduct aerobic exercise in the lab and at home, by either walking or cycling initially at 50% of the calculated heart rate reserve for 20 min three times per week, and this will be increased in stepwise increments by 10% each week, if tolerable.\n\nMuscular resistance training will be also carried out 3 times a week to avoid muscle soreness. Persons will be instructed to do push-up, sit-ups, and standing strides (lunges) until volitional fatigue increasing this number to reach 12 repetitions. The resistance chosen for strengthening of biceps, deltoids and quadriceps will be based on what the person can lift to reach volitional fatigue with 8 repetitions.\n\nPsychological program\n\nIt is expected that patients undergoing surgery for cancer are anxious with some component of depression. Since both anxiety and depression can influence the motivation to carry out social and functional activities, psychological strategies can be put in place to help patients to cope with the stress of surgery and disease. For this reason patients will be seen by a trained psychologist. Patients will receive a total of 1.5 hours of psychological intervention in the first session and more sessions if necessary.\n\nIn the first preoperative session, the first hour will address the patient's anxieties, coping strategies, and post-operative expectations, with the goal of optimizing psychological well-being \\& ways of coping with surgery. The importance of the patient's active participation in the healing process will also be discussed. The last thirty minutes will be devoted to teaching relaxation techniques and breathing exercises. Patients will be given a relaxation CD to take home for practice.\n\nNutritional supplementation\n\nThe nutritional status of patients affected by lung cancer is directly influenced by the presence of cancer, which impacts on all aspects of intermediary (protein, carbohydrate, lipid, trace element, vitamin) metabolism, and by other factors such as age, adjuvant cancer therapy and stage of the disease. The greater sensitivity of protein catabolism to nutritional support, in particular to amino acids, could have important implications for the nutritional management of these patients during the period of catabolic stress, with particular emphasis on substrate utilization and energy requirement.\n\nThe patients' nutritional status and dietary intake will be assessed by the nutritionist. Percentage of lean body mass and fat percentage will be measured. All patients will receive a daily dietary supplement known as whey protein (Immunocal, Immunotec \u00a9). Special precautions will be considered if patients have specific medical conditions (e.g. diabetes).",

    "brief_summary": "This is a phase I/IIa open, uncontrolled, international, prospective clinical trial, in an out-patient setting, in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.\n\nThe phase I part of the study consists of a dose escalation phase, in which the recommended dose (RD) for the phase IIa part of the study will be established based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). In the phase IIa part of the study, additional patients will be included at the RD, to confirm the safety and explore the activity of that dose.\n\nThis study will take place in Switzerland (2 sites) and Germany (11 sites).",
    "detailed_description": "Medical Need:\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in developed countries; about 87% of lung cancers are of the NSCLC type. Patients with more advanced but non-metastatic disease (IIIA or IIIB) usually undergo chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, with or without secondary surgical resection. Patients with progression after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may receive second-line treatment with targeted therapies. Despite these aggressive treatments, only about 5% of patients with metastatic disease survive for 5 or more years. Given these dismal statistics, it is clear that new therapeutic approaches for treatment of NSCLC are urgently needed.\n\nPotential Benefits:\n\nCV9201 is an mRNA-based vaccine for the treatment of human NSCLC that is based on CureVac's RNActive\u00ae technology.\n\nAs an mRNA-based vaccine, CV9201 features several advantages over other approaches: it is highly specific, there is no restriction to the patient's MHC genotype, and it does not need to cross the nuclear membrane to be active. Finally, in the absence of reverse transcriptase, RNA can not be integrated into the genome.\n\nFor the planned first-in-man study, CV9201 will be administered in 5 doses. The phase I part of this phase I/IIa study is a dose finding study, to determine the RD for the phase IIa part.",

    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy (CT), such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy (RT) uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving these treatments before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy and radiation therapy are more effective when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying chemotherapy and radiation therapy to see how well they work when given with or without panitumumab in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.",

Radiotherapy will be delivered twice a day over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks. The duration of treatment will vary individually according to the delivered dose to the tumour area.",
    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nApproximately 12,000 patients are diagnosed with stage III NSCLC in the UK each year and their survival is \\~15% at 5 years. As the majority of patients are not suitable for the gold standard treatment (concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CTRT), novel strategies integrating radiotherapy (RT) technological advances and radiobiological knowledge need to be evaluated in patients treated with the alternative treatment option, sequential CTRT. There is solid evidence that improving local control in lung cancer leads to increased survival. Strategies to improve local control in stage III NSCLC include dose escalation and individualisation which are limited by the dose delivered to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesise that this will be facilitated by the use of IMRT.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of delivering isotoxic RT using IMRT and hyperfractionated accelerated RT in stage III NSCLC patients who are not suitable for concurrent CTRT.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Delivery of isotoxic IMRT to dose \\>60 Gy EQD2 (total biologically equivalent in 2 Gy fraction).\n\nSecondary endpoints: Estimation of the suitability for lung isotoxic IMRT, estimation of proportion of patients with acute grade 3+ non haematological toxicity, estimation of late toxicity, estimation of local control/overall survival and development of a robust Quality Assurance (QA) process for lung IMRT.\n\nDesign:\n\nProspective multicentre, non-randomised feasibility study with early stopping rules.\n\n35 patients will be recruited in this prospective multicentre feasibility study. Stopping rules are in place to ensure the safety of patients. We estimate that this regimen would be of added value to a national randomised phase II trial if 80% of the patients can be planned to a dose \\>60 Gy EQD2.\n\nIntervention:\n\nPatients with stage III NSCLC, PS 0-2, not suitable for concurrent CTRT, will be treated with individualised doses of radiation based on pre-specified normal tissue doses (spinal cord, brachial plexus, lung tissue, heart and great vessels/proximal bronchial tree). Radiotherapy will be delivered twice-daily over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks using IMRT and the dose of radiation will be increased until one or more of the organs at risk tolerance or the maximum dose of 79.2 Gy is reached.",

    "brief_summary": "This study will examine whether cytokine gene polymorphisms affect the progression or response to therapy of bone marrow failure disorders. Cytokine genes instruct cells to produce proteins called cytokines that influence immune system response. As with many genes, the cytokine genes differ slightly from person to person. These differences are called gene polymorphisms. Different patients with the same bone marrow failure disease often progress and respond to treatment differently. This study will look at the possible role of cytokine gene polymorphisms in these differences.\n\nPatients between 2 and 80 years old who have participated in an NHLBI Hematology Branch treatment protocol for acquired aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or pure red cell aplasia are recruited to participate in this study. Blood collected and stored at the time of screening for the treatment protocol will be tested for cytokine gene polymorphisms. No additional tests, procedures, or treatments are involved in this study.",
    "detailed_description": "The NHLBI Hematology Branch is investigating features that may affect the clinical course of bone marrow failure patients.\n\nWe are particularly interested in identifying factors, which determine treatment response and outcome. Cytokines are biological mediators of the immune response. In a normal population there is considerable variation in the precise sequence of the genes which control cytokine production (Cytokine Gene Polymorphism or CGP). As a consequence individuals differ in the quality of the immune response they mount against self or foreign antigens. Since the bone marrow failure disorders aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome involve auto-immune suppression of marrow function, it is important to discover whether there are any recurrent patterns of cytokine production in these disorders which may contribute to the marrow failure. This can be done by studying the sequences of the genes that control cytokine production to find out whether there are any recurrent gene patterns in the diseases studied. In addition we need to understand why some patients fail to respond to immunosuppressive treatments. By comparing CGP in responders and non-responders we may be able to find patterns of cytokine production that are favorable or unfavorable for response. Better understanding of CGPs in marrow failure syndromes should make it possible to improve the outcome for patients who fail immune suppression by using drugs which block specific cytokines.\n\nNone of these polymorphisms are associated with known clinical disease to be classifiable as a 'genetic defect'. All testing will be done on samples collected and stored for research purposes from consenting bone marrow failure subjects who have or will be participating on Hematology Branch research protocols.",

    "brief_summary": "Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (75% of lung cancer) is associated with involvement of the parietal pleura and or chest wall (soft tissue and/or bone) in 5-8% of patients. Invasion of the chest wall increases the T staging in the Tumor, Node, Mestasis (TNM) classification system of lung cancer to a T3 and is associated with decreased survival and more extensive operative procedures. The reported 5-year survival for patients with T2 tumors is 58% compared to 38% in patients with T3 lesions. The American college of Chest Physician has still not identified the best tool to assess chest wall invasion by lung cancer, CT-Scan being used by physicians for this assessment. In some studies, CT scan has been shown to have a sensitivity ranging from 42 % to 68 % in assessing chest wall invasion, and a specificity ranging from 66 % to 100 %.\n\nTrans-thoracic Ultrasound (US) has the capacity of allowing for dynamic real-time imaging of the pulmonary lesion and the chest wall. Therefore, US has the potential to allow for the appreciation of subtle findings related to the movement of the lesion and lung over the chest wall. Hence, US might be an accurate tool to assess chest wall invasion by lung cancer; thus improving pre-operative diagnosis, staging and operative planning of patient with chest wall invasion.\n\nHowever US is not currently utilized in the pre-operative assessment of patients with lung cancer invading the pleura and chest wall, and has not been extensively studied.\n\nIn some rare studies evaluating the accuracy of US, results have shown a sensitivity ranging from 89% to 100% and a specificity ranging from 95% to 98% for US detecting chest wall invasion by lung cancer. However those studies got criticized. Bandi et al study, got criticized by the fact that the operators in the study were experienced interventional pulmonologists who perform hundreds of thoracic and endoscopic ultrasound per year. Nobuo et al study took place in 1993, since when the device of US has evolved, the investigators can not apply with certainty the findings of this study.\n\nConsequently, there is a need to conduct a study to evaluate the accuracy of US to assess chest wall invasion by lung cancer.\n\nIn this prospective study the investigators will assess the accuracy of US, and then compare it to the accuracy of the CT-Scan",

    "detailed_description": "Physical functioning is found to be an important predictor for survival and physical ability 'to do what one wants' affects quality of life in cancer patients in palliative care and their spouses. Despite this, physical functioning is reported as a neglected dimension in palliative care quality of life outcome measures, and advanced cancer patients report that they do not receive the help they need. The vast majority of patients with advanced cancer described unmet palliative care needs, and with the most frequently reported problems being; fatigue (73%), limitations doing physical activities (65%), limitations in work and daily activities (58%), worry (58%), difficulties with sexuality (54%), pain (52%) and problems with concentration (43%). Furthermore, limitations in physical functioning and physical activity is a leading cause of distress and psychological problems a rehabilitative approach in palliative care integrated in the interdisciplinary interventions to the patients must be maintained throughout the entire illness trajectory from diagnosis through treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care to address such problems.\n\nHowever, prevalence of patient unmet needs and reported physical functioning and performance is reported to differentiate largely between palliative units.\n\nIn order to address the functional needs of patients receiving specialist palliative care studies of their specific needs are required. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the patient reported unmet needs for function and supportive occupational- and physiotherapy rehabilitation interventions in the palliative unit at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. Furthermore, we aim to investigate if observations, additional disease-specific patient reported outcomes and assessment of physical function and performance can support the unmet needs.",

Although VATS is less painful than thoracotomy, patients may feel severe pain during the first hours of the postoperative period. Analgesia management is very important for these patients in the postoperative period since insufficient analgesia can cause pulmonary complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and increased oxygen consumption. Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided. It has been reported that SPSIPB provides effective analgesia after VATS. US-guided serratus anterior plane (SAP) block provides effective analgesia in the thorax's anterior, posterior, and lateral dermatomes.

    "detailed_description": "Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has started to be considered the standard surgical procedure for lung surgery in recent years. The advantages of VATS compared to open thoracotomy are rapid recovery, shorter hospital stays, and low risk of complications. Although it is a less painful surgical procedure compared to thoracotomy, severe acute postoperative pain can be observed especially in the first hours after VATS. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), which is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia, is used in analgesia after VATS. However, due to the difference in surgical technique and trauma between open surgery and VATS, what should be the gold standard for analgesia after VATS is a matter of debate. It is supported that less invasive analgesic techniques should be applied for minimally invasive surgical procedures, especially due to the difficulty of applying TEA and its side-effect profile. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is considered the first-line regional technique for VATS surgery. However, it is difficult to apply due to its anatomical proximity to important structures such as the pleura and central neuraxial system, and it may cause complications such as pneumothorax and vascular injury. Analgesia management is very important in these patients, as insufficient analgesia in the postoperative period may cause pulmonary complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and increased oxygen consumption.\n\nUltrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided.\n\nIn the cadaveric study of Tulgar et al., it was determined that the spread of serratus posterior superior interfacial plane block; 7-10 intercostal levels on the left side only in the superficial fascia of the trapezius muscle. Spread dye was observed at intercostal levels, absent on the right. There was prominent staining on both sides of the deep trapezius muscle. Both the surface and skin of the rhomboid major were stained, while the rhomboid minor was only stained in the skin. SPSP block will provide successful analgesia in procedures involving the thoracic region such as chronic myofascial pain, breast surgery, thoracic surgery, and shoulder surgery. There is no randomized study in the literature evaluating the effectiveness of SPSP block for postoperative analgesia management after VATS.\n\nUS-guided serratus anterior plane (SAP) block is an interfascial plane block and was described by Blanco in 2013. A local anesthetic solution is performed into the fascial plane of the serratus anterior muscle. It is easy to perform and has low complication rate because it is far away from the important neurological and vascular structures. The serratus anterior muscle may be seen easily with US guidance in the mid-axillary line. It provides effective analgesia in anterior, posterior, and lateral dermatomes of the thorax. It has been reported that SAP block provides effective postoperative pain management following thoracotomy, breast surgery, and VATS. There is no clinical randomized study in the literature evaluating the efficacy of SPSIPB and SAP block following VATS.\n\nThis study aims to compare US-guided SPSIPB and SAP block for postoperative analgesia management after VATS. The primary aim is to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aims are to evaluate postoperative pain scores (NRS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting) and complications due to blocks (pneumothorax, hematoma).",

    "brief_summary": "The development of biomarkers will lead the dynamic of personalized medicine and fill the unsatisfied needs in oncology for prediction of therapeutic response.\n\nMolecular imaging enables non invasive quantification of biomarkers. The development of molecular imaging biomarkers is closely related to the development of therapeutic molecules. Among the potential targets, kinases offer a lot of advantages: (i) they play a central role in cellular regulation, (ii) numerous kinase-specific small molecule libraries exist in biotech and pharma industry, (iii) several kinase-targeted therapies are used in clinic (imatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib\u2026) with application across a variety of therapeutic indications. Among the imaging technologies, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the most sensitive and dedicated to evaluate small molecules. However few radiotracers are available and their specificity limits their clinical use. The IMAkinib\u00ae approach is an innovative method proposed to develop new PET radiotracers adapted to current medical and economical challenges.\n\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an established target for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Gefitinib (Iressa\u00ae), erlotinib (Tarceva\u00ae) and afatinib (Giotrif\u00ae) have already been approved for treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations (L858R or del exon 19). Unfortunately the majority of patients will develop a resistance to the TKI in the long term (6-12 months). If the mechanism of resistance is not yet fully characterized, most patients (50%) will acquire an additional T790M mutation of EGFR. TKI PET-imaging can provide a tool to determine and predict responsiveness to EGFR TKI in vivo. That is why, the investigators have selected and radiolabeled (18-Fluor) a compound targeting specifically EGFR mutated (\\[18F\\]-ODS2004436) which was further evaluated in a preclinical imaging study to determine the feasibility of TKI-PET. The investigators proved in vivo that \\[18F\\]-ODS2004436 a compound is a good candidate to evaluate the EGFR activity in human lung tumours using PET imaging.",

    "brief_summary": "Fanconi's Anemia is an inherited disorder that can produce bone marrow failure. In addition, some patients with Fanconi's anemia have physical defects usually involving the skeleton and kidneys. The major problem for most patients is aplastic anemia, the blood counts for red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are low because the bone marrow fails to produce these cells. Some patients with Fanconi's anemia can develop leukemia or cancers of other organs.\n\nMany laboratory studies have suggested that Fanconi's anemia is caused by an inherited defect in the ability of cells to repair DNA. Recently, the gene for one of the four types of Fanconi's anemia, type C, has been identified. It is known that this gene is defective in patients with Fanconi's anemia type C.\n\nResearchers have conducted laboratory studies that suggest Fanconi's anemia type C may be treatable with gene therapy. Gene therapy works by placing a normal gene into the cells of patients with abnormal genes responsible for Fanconi's anemia type C. After the normal gene is in place, new normal cells can develop and grow. Drugs can be given to these patients kill the remaining abnormal cells. The new cells containing normal genes and will not be harmed by these drugs.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to test whether researchers can safely place the normal Fanconi's anemia type C gene into cells of patients with the disease. The gene will be placed into special cells in the bone marrow called stem cells. These stem cells are responsible for producing new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.",
    "detailed_description": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive pancytopenia, congenital abnormalities, and predisposition to malignancy. Therapy is currently limited to allogeneic marrow transplantation; patients lacking a suitable donor usually die from aplasia or acute leukemia. Recently, mutation in a novel gene named FACC (Fanconi anemia C-complementing) has been identified as causing one type of FA. FACC mutations, which introduce splicing errors or stop codons, have been identified in 15% of FA patients. We have recently been successful in functional complementation of four FA cell lines using retroviral vectors to transfer a copy of the normal FACC gene. We also analyzed the ability of four viral vectors to functionally correct hematopoietic progenitor cells from a patient bearing a splice donor mutation. As for the lymphoid cell lines, these CD34 enriched cells were extremely sensitive to MMC. After injection of these progenitor cells with viral vectors bearing normal FACC, the progenitors gave rise to increased numbers of colonies both in the absence and presence of up to 5 nM MMC, whereas control cells were completely destroyed by 1 nM MMC. In summary, we have demonstrated that: (1) retroviral vectors can be engineered to transfer a normal FACC gene to FA(C) lymphoid cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells; (2) introduction of a normal FACC gene into CD34+ progenitors markedly enhances their growth in the absence and presence of MMC.\n\nThis study is designed to determine whether hematopoietic progenitors transduced with the normal FACC gene can be re-infused safely into FA(C) patients. CD34+ cells obtained from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood will be transduced ex vivo over a 72 hour period in the presence of IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor with the FACC retroviral vector. These transduced cells will be re-infused into FA(C) patients. Patients will be monitored for toxicities as well as evidence of successful gene transfer and expression. The procedure will be repeated up to a total of 4 times with each treatment 2-4 months apart. Theoretically, these rescued stem cells should have a selective growth advantage within the hypoplastic FA marrow environment in vivo.",

    "detailed_description": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal malignancy that is not treatable with targeted therapies and that does not respond long-term to treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy1. One distinguishing molecular characteristic of SCLC is very high expression levels of thymidylate synthase (TS). TS plays an important role in de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and the very high TS levels expressed in SCLC cells indicate that these cells require the de novo nucleotide biosynthetic pathway to proliferate. Thus, complete TS inhibition could result in highly favorable outcomes in SCLC patients. TS inhibitors have been evaluated in SCLC clinical trials and have anti-tumoral activity when combined with a second chemotherapeutic agent. However, treatment with TS inhibitors has not been shown to surpass other combination chemotherapy regimens. An important point regarding these clinical studies is that TS activity levels were not monitored as an endpoint of drug response, thus it is not known whether TS activity was efficiently inhibited.Investigators predict that complete TS inhibition will result in favorable outcomes.\n\nWith support from Wake Innovations, Investigators are developing a novel fluoropyrimidine polymer, CF10, which strongly inhibits TS. CF10 is a second generation fluoropyrimidine polymer. The first generation polymer, F10, showed excellent anti-cancer activity in animal models of acute myeloid leukemia, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer. CF10 is designed to have improved tumor penetration and better in vivo stability than F10. Investigators hypothesize that CF10 will be highly effective for treating SCLC both as a single agent and in combination with TS inhibitors that target alternative sites of the TS enzyme.\n\nAfter establishing CF10 has activity as a single agent and in combination with folate-based TS inhibitors (e.g. pemetrexed) in SCLC cell lines and xenograft models, Investigators will test CF10 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and in organoids derived from SCLC patient samples. Investigators will develop PDX models of SCLC and SCLC organoids using transbronchial fine needle aspiration (FNA) from SCLC patients at Baptist/WFBCCC collected by co-I's Bellinger, Dotson, and Thomas. Non-malignant cells will be collected using a brush biopsy to enable comparison of malignant and non-malignant tissue from the same patient with regard to mechanistic endpoints.",

Surgical resection of the primary NSCLC can occur by open thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATs) and resection can be achieved by segmentectomy, lobectomy, sleeve resection, bilobectomy or pneumonectomy. Patients undergoing wedge resection are not eligible for this study.\n\n   Criteria for prior systemic chemotherapy/radiotherapy:\n9. Patients should have completed (or be undergoing) curative intent therapy (surgery \u00b1 neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy; adjuvant therapy can include PORT) with exceptions noted below:\n\n   Patients who discontinue chemotherapy and/or PORT for toxicity prior to completion of all planned therapy are eligible.\n\n   Patients who have not received any neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, and meet all other eligibility criteria, may be eligible under the following circumstances:\n   * All patients who are eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy MUST be offered adjuvant chemotherapy.\n   * The patient has declined adjuvant chemotherapy, and in the opinion of the Investigator, this is the patient's final decision after receiving appropriate information and adequate time to make the decision. The patient's refusal of adjuvant chemotherapy must be documented.\n   * If in the view of the Investigator, adjuvant chemotherapy is contraindicated due to an underlying intercurrent illness/laboratory abnormality, which is not considered reversible within a reasonable timeframe for the patient to be eligible for adjuvant therapy, which must be documented.\n\n   Criteria assessed prior to and at the start of surveillance:\n10. Confirmation of suitable biosamples for WES and central PD-L1 testing. Resected tumor tissue and whole blood samples must be provided to the diagnostic laboratory for WES of tumor and germline DNA, respectively as soon as possible following pathology confirmation. Samples must be sent no later than 1-2 weeks after completion of adjuvant therapy or 3-5 weeks after surgery (if no adjuvant therapy is given) for development of the Sponsor-approved personalized panel for MRD detection at a central reference laboratory. Germline sequencing of whole blood is mandatory. Resected tumor tissue must also be provided for PD-L1 testing at a central reference laboratory (see inclusion criteria 15).\n11. Post-adjuvant therapy or post-surgery (if no adjuvant therapy is given) CT scan of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands) and brain MRI \\[preferred\\] or brain CT with IV contrast should be available to confirm no evidence of metastasis. If scans were not performed post-curative intent therapy, additional scans must be done prior to start of surveillance.\n12. Consents to be accessible for q6w\u00b13d plasma sample collection for MRD evaluation and for q12w\u00b11w CT scans during the 96-week surveillance period.\n13.

CT scan of the chest and abdomen (including liver and adrenal glands) and brain MRI \\[preferred\\] or brain CT with IV contrast performed within the 28 days \u00b1 7 days prior to randomization to confirm no evidence of RECIST 1.1-defined disease recurrence and/or metastasis.\n15. Known tumor PD-L1 status determined at a central reference laboratory testing service using a validated Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay prior randomization. Patients with unknown PD-L1 status are not eligible for the study.\n16. WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1.\n17. Complete post-operative wound healing must have occurred prior to randomization; patients must have recovered from all acute, reversible toxic effects from prior treatments (excluding alopecia) that could potentially adversely impact further administration of durvalumab/placebo according to the Investigator's judgment.\n18. Must have recovered from all acute, reversible toxic effects from chemotherapy that could potentially adversely impact further administration of durvalumab or placebo according to the Investigator's judgment\n19.

EGFR/ALK may be tested centrally if local testing is unavailable.\n2. Mixed small cell and NSCLC histology.\n3. Require re-resection or are deemed to have unresectable NSCLC by amultidisciplinary evaluation that must include a thoracic surgeon who performs lung cancer surgery as a significant part of their practice.\n4. Baseline imaging demonstrating unequivocal evidence of RECIST 1.1-defined disease recurrence or evidence of clinical recurrence outside of imaging prior to randomization. In the event of lymphadenopathy on imaging that would lead to exclusion, histopathological confirmation of lymph node metastasis should be obtained prior to excluding a patient from the study. If pathological confirmation of lymph node metastasis is not technically feasible and imaging appearance are deemed unequivocal for relapse, the patient will be excluded.\n\n   Medical conditions\n5.

People with lung cancer who are shielding may have been particularly affected as they may be unable to carry out many of their normal daily activities, such as grocery shopping and exercise, and are unable to interact with friends and family. People with lung cancer will also have experienced some changes to the clinical services available to them at The Christie. Using a questionnaire and interviews, the investigators want to understand patient experiences of the changes in their daily lives and the changes to their clinical care. This will help us to see if people with lung cancer need any additional support services or if there are any changes the investigators can make to clinical services to improve patient experiences. Eligible patients will be any lung cancer patients receiving current treatment or in active follow up.",
    "detailed_description": "The COVID-19 pandemic, declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020, has managed to dramatically change all of our lives in just a few short months. Due to the unprecedented demand to protect the National Health service (NHS), on 23 March 2020 the United Kingdom (UK) government initiated a lock down, imposing wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement. Cancer services have been being particularly impacted across the country.\n\nAround 48,000 patients are newly diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK each year. Those who require active treatment may be offered radiotherapy, systemic anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy, or a combination of both. A recent document published by Public Health England(PHE) has classified lung cancer patients receiving any of these treatments as 'extremely vulnerable.' Common co-existing comorbidities such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) also place patients into this category. Their vulnerability may be further amplified when considering that 44% of all new lung cancer diagnoses are in people aged \\>75 years and a significant proportion is particularly frail. The advice from PHE for these 'extremely vulnerable' patients was to shield, meaning they should not leave their homes or attend any social gatherings, even with family or friends. Shielding unfortunately is not without its own challenges. It may prevent many patients from carrying out their daily life activities independently, limit their ability to exercise and impact their mental further. This is particularly relevant for those patients more vulnerable or frail. It would therefore be expected that these patients are likely to develop some degree of psychological distress. The act of shielding itself may be implicated in this owing to increased social isolation, upset to normal routines and general anxiety regarding COVID-19 related or other issues. In addition any change to routine lung cancer management in these patients may exacerbate this distress further. Those with underlying mental health issues are at particular risk.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic both the lung cancer diagnosis and its subsequent management have been affected. These rapid changes reflected the shifting risk-benefit ratio for patients and diminished resources. Beyond modifications in treatment pathways, telephone consultations have replaced many face to face appointments in an attempt to reduce visits to hospital. The use of electronic Health tools and telemedicine has therefore suddenly come to the fore front of clinical practice.\n\nAt the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, all lung cancer patients have been given the opportunity to regularly complete electronic patient reported outcome measures routinely as part of their clinical care since December 2018. Patients are sent a text message either on the day of a new patient appointment or three days before a follow-up appointment. They are asked to complete the electronic Patient Reported Outcome Measures specifically selected for each patient's diagnosis and treatment pathway including a list of symptoms based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The EuroQual-5D quality of life questionnaire is also included. This allows clinicians to review patients' symptoms before the consultation, allowing him/her to focus on the concerning symptoms and quality of life issues. Moreover, all new lung cancer patients are also screened for frailty within the Frailty Project through the electronic use of Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale which is performed by clinicians.",
