Approximately eighty patients with recurrent supratentorial glioblastoma will enroll in stage 2 of the study.\n\nStage 2 has 2 arms and is randomized, like the flip of a coin. Arm 1 is Lerapolturev and Arm 2 is Lomustine. After the recurrent tumor has been removed by surgery, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either the FDA-approved chemotherapy (lomustine) or the study drug (lerapolturev). Subjects receive lerapolturev infused in the residual disease via CED twice, 4-day apart. About 1 week after the 2nd lerapolturev infusion, subjects will start subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of lerapolturev into the area of the cervical lymph nodes (head and neck) nearest to their tumor weekly for 4 weeks and afterward every 3 weeks for about a year.\n\nSubjects assigned to receive lomustine will begin taking it 3-4 weeks after surgery to remove their recurrent tumor. One prescribed dose of lomustine will be taken no more than once every 6 weeks, for no more than 1 year or up to 9 cycles.\n\nSubjects will be followed for serious adverse events (side effects) for 30 days after stopping the study. Subjects' medical records will be reviewed for the remainder of their life, in order to collect data on subsequent treatments, disease progression, tumor size/volume, and survival.\n\nThere are risks to the study drug, lerapolturev, and the chemotherapy drug, lomustine. The most common risks of lerapolturev are headache, seizure, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty thinking or processing, difficulty receiving or responding to sensory information, fatigue, and difficulty speaking or comprehending. Risks associated with infusion procedure include mild discomfort at the infusion site, bleeding in the brain, pain, infection, and swelling of the brain. The study drug and procedures used together could also potentially cause more serious side effects. The most common risks of lomustine are changes in your red blood cell count, changes in platelets, changes in your liver, feeling confused and tired, poor appetite, and loss of ability to conceive or father a child.",

The trial will be conducted in two parts.\n\nPart 1 is a single-arm, sequential 3+3 dose-escalation of allogeneic CMV-specific T cells as a monotherapy and in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab to determine the recommended dose(s) for future exploration. Up to 18 participants will be recruited for part 1. Part 2 will involve two arms and will examine the clinical impact of the CMV-specific T cells as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. Forty participants will be recruited for part 2 - 20 with newly diagnosed GBM/astrocytoma grade 4 and 20 with recurrent GBM/astrocytoma grade 4.\n\nPart 2 will only be initiated if the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) determines that the proposed dose level(s) for future exploration are safe and well tolerated. Additional groups may be explored depending on emergent safety, pharmacodynamics and/or clinical efficacy data.\n\nFollowing screening and enrolment, each participant will receive four weekly infusions (Q1W) of allogeneic CMV-specific T cells, followed by up to 18 infusions of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab infusions will commence seven days (\u00b13 days) after the final T-cell infusion, and be administered every 6 weeks (Q6W). The total duration of participation for each participant is approximately 26 months.\n\nEfficacy of the combination therapy will be evaluated according to the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) and immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria, through radiographic imaging. For group A and group B the appropriate measures for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate and duration of response will be assessed.",

Once qualified to the study patients will be randomized to one of the treatment arms. Then patients randomized to treatment arm 1 and 2 will receive first dose of neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab on day 4 and day 18 (200mg each). An immuno-PET scan for these arm 1 and 2 patients will be performed on day 29 and 30. Up to 72 hours after last immuno-PET scan all patients will undergo tumor resection. After surgery all patients will be treated in accordance with standard of care (Stupp protocol) with combined radio- and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy will consist of 60Gy over 6 weeks in daily fraction of 2Gy in Mo-Fri setting and parallel chemotherapy with Temozolomide of 75mg/m2 of BSA on a daily basis. After completion of radiotherapy the chemotherapy will continue for six cycles of 28 days with 150-200mg/m2 Temozolomide on days 1-5 of each cycle. In addition, patients randomized to arm 1 will receive 16 cycles of 21 days with Pembrolizumab treatment in adjuvant setting of 200mg/cycle.\n\nDuring treatment period all patients will be assessed every three months and MRI will be performed in order to evaluate disease status/response.\n\nAfter EOT patient's follow up period will continue for up to 3 years from initial resection with MRI assessment every 3 months.\n\nIf progression/relapse is identified, patients will undergo a tumor resection or biopsy within 48 hours thereafter.\n\nAll patients will then stay in follow up until the end of three years follow up period or death from any cause.\n\nThe evaluation of safety, tolerability, and quality-of-life (QoL) will be based on adverse event reporting criteria (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE/WHO Classification of Diseases - ICD10), ECOG status assessment, KPS assessment, EORTC - QLQ-C30 and EORTC-QLQ-BN20 scale.\n\nClinical assessment will be based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO). For patients treated with immunotherapy beyond onset of objective disease progression, the iRANO scale will be used within first 6 months of immunotherapy.\n\nDue to a significant risk of identifying other pathology than GBM (i.e. metastasic tumor) in post-surgery histopathology it is anticipated that up to additional 6 patients may be recruited in order to achieve planned number of evaluable patients.",

    "brief_summary": "The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). The investigators have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Super-selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent GBM. Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that the investigators seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of intraarterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent malignant glioma. By achieving the aims of this study the investigators will also determine if IV therapy with Bevacizumab should be combined with repeated selected intraarterial Bevacizumab to improve progression free and overall survival. The investigators expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to the patients in the near future.",
    "detailed_description": "The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for patients to receive Bevacizumab (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg every two weeks until their tumor grows more than 25%. At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. We have recently completed a Phase I clinical trial that has shown that SIACI of Bevacizumab is safe and effective up to a dose of 15mg/kg in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. This two arm open-label, non-randomized trial is a follow up study to that trial and will ask two simple questions: Is it safe to deliver repeated doses of Bevacizumab intraarterially using these super selective intraarterial delivery techniques? Is it necessary to combine this IA regimen of treatment with biweekly IV Bevacizumab in order to improve progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)? Information from this trial will yield important answers to the durability and efficacy of this delivery technique and may radically change the way chemotherapy is given to our patients with brain tumors.\n\nCurrent Standard of Care:\n\nDay 0: Intravenous Bevacizumab (10mg/kg) Day 14, 28 (and every two weeks thereafter): Intravenous Bevacizumab\n\nTherefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:\n\n1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol 20%; 12.5 mL/s over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma. We have used this without complication in the 30 patients from our Phase I protocol as well.\n2. To treat patients with one of two arms with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of Bevacizumab for patients with recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. Each arm gets IA delivery with one arm getting IV Bevacizumab biweekly as well and the other arm not getting intervening IV therapy. In each arm, IA therapy is repeated when MRI shows progression. Persistent progression after three intraarterial chemotherapies would remove the patient from the trial.",

    "brief_summary": "Background: Infiltrative low grade gliomas (LGGs) are the most common primary central nervous system malignancies excluding the highest grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme. Craniotomy with maximal safe tumor resection is endeavored to achieve longer survivals in LGG patients. Unfortunately, due to the infiltrative nature of gliomas and the frequent tumor location in eloquent areas, gross total resection is usually not applicable. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2015 guidelines, postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is recommended for most adult patients with low-grade infiltrative LGGs in order to enhance local control and prolong progression-free survival (PFS), except those who are no older than 40 years of age and in whom maximal safe resection is not feasible. However, brain irradiation-related neurocognitive function (NCF) sequelae are potentially and indeed a concern which should not be ignored. In terms of the time course of cranial irradiation-induced NCF decline, it might vary considerably according to the specific domains which are selected to be measured. Early neurocognitive decline principally involve impairments of episodic memory, which has been significantly associated with functions of the hippocampus. This study thus aims to investigate the impact of partial brain irradiation with using contemporary radiotherapeutic techniques on neurocognitive performances, intracranial local control, and progression-free survival in patients with intracranial high-risk grade 2 or 3 gliomas.\n\nMethods: Patients with intracranial high-risk low-grade or grade 3 gliomas will be enrolled to this study once postoperative adjuvant RT is recommended. All eligible and recruited patients should receive baseline functional brain MRI examination and baseline neurobehavioral assessment. Subsequently, partial cranial irradiation will be initiated within one month approximately after enrollment. Brain RT dose will be 5000 - 6000 cGy in 25 - 30 fraction during 5 - 7 weeks. Accordingly, a battery of neuropsychological measures, which includes 7 standardized neuropsychological tests (e.g., executive functions, verbal \\& non-verbal memory, working memory, and psychomotor speed), is used to evaluate neurobehavioral functions for our registered patients. The primary outcome measure is delayed recall, as determined by the change/decline in verbal memory or non-verbal memory from the baseline assessment to 4 months after the start of postoperative adjuvant RT.",

    "brief_summary": "Patients with glioblastoma face a grim prognosis. Despite recent advancement in neurosurgical technology and neuro-oncology glioblastomas almost invariably progress or recur after a median of 4-8 months. The strategy to repeat tumor resection at recurrence in order to minimize tumor load and thus to facilitate subsequent second-line therapy has been shown to be feasible and safe.\n\nHowever, evidence for a survival benefit of surgery for recurrent glioblastoma is scarce and relies entirely on retrospective analyses. While most retrospective analyses report an apparent survival benefit, an EORTC meta-analysis on second-line therapies found no survival difference in patients with or without surgery at recurrence. With regard to the risks and costs inherent to surgery for glioblastoma, a randomized controlled trial is required.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to compare the effect of craniotomy and tumor resection followed by adjuvant second-line therapy to no surgery followed by second-line therapy on overall survival, neurological status, and quality of life. Analysis of overall survival will be used to improve sample size estimation of a subsequent phase III trial for craniotomy and tumor resection of glioblastoma recurrence in cooperation with the EORTC.",
    "detailed_description": "Background\n\nGlioblastoma is a malignant, locally invasive brain tumor whose prognosis remains grim despite various intense treatment modalities. In the past, radical surgery was met with skepticism due to the aggressive infiltrative character of the tumor. However, an increasing number of retrospective studies over the last decade suggest a survival benefit for surgery. A recent post-hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial on the use of the surgical adjunct 5-ALA reported a prolonged overall survival from 11.9 to 16.7 months (evidence level 2a) after more extensive resection. Thus, maximal safe resection has become a mainstay of treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, followed by adjuvant radio-chemotherapy.\n\nGlioblastoma almost invariably recurs after a median of 6.9 months, leaving but few options for further treatment. Recurrence of glioblastoma after surgery and concomitant adjuvant therapy represents an additional therapeutic challenge and may be treated with second-line pharmacotherapy. In addition, a second surgery may also be considered in highly selected patients.\n\nThe rationale for surgery - maximum safe resection - is to prolong survival through reduction of tumor load, and, maybe due to an increased efficacy of adjuvant treatment. However, surgery carries risks of complications, that may result in a decreased functional and survival outcome. The crucial question therefore is whether, to what extent, and at what costs in terms of neurological risks a second resection prolongs survival.\n\nObjective\n\nThe primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare survival outcome after surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy to no surgery followed by second-line therapy in recurrent glioblastoma. An auxiliary objective to primary objective is to compare the survival outcomes of operated patients to control in the subgroups stratified by extent of resection: incomplete resection (non-CRET) vs complete resection (CRET).\n\nSecondary objectives are: assessment of recruitment for all screened patients, comparison of progression-free survival between treatment arms, evaluation of crossover and comparison of patient quality of life between treatment arms.\n\nSafety objectives are: to assess neurological deficits, local infections and morbidity associated to surgery and hospital stay after surgery and during follow-up.\n\nMethods\n\nAll patients (\u226518 years) with a radiological suspicion of first recurrence of glioblastoma are screened for this trial. Patients eligible for study participation are informed on the treatment options for recurrent glioblastoma (surgery followed by adjuvant second-line therapy, second-line therapy, or palliative therapy alone) by the center investigators. Patients randomized to the control group will receive second-line therapy according to local guidelines. Patients randomized to the interventional group will receive a craniotomy and resection of the tumor followed by adjuvant second-line therapy. Outcome will be measured at 3 months intervals.\n\nRecruitment rate and reason for non-inclusion will be monitored.",

    "detailed_description": "High grade gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite aggressive treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, these tumors have a dismal prognosis. Following a radiation therapy, almost 80% of them recur locally. The focus of this project is the development of a radiation sensitizer (a small molecule ATM inhibitor, WSD0628) with the goal to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. The first step will be to establish a pre-clinical PK\u2192PD\u2192efficacy model to describe WSD0628 plasma and tumor concentrations associated with robust ATM inhibition and radiosensitizing effects. This model will be instrumental in interpreting the pharmacokinetic (PK) data and dosage selection in the proposed first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study in approximately 42 adult patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. The aims of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, PKs and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WSD0628 in combination with radiation therapy. The dose-escalation portion of the study (Part A) will enroll approximately 24 patients and is comprised of Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design with target toxicity rate of 22%-33%. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is established, Part B of the study will commence in which an additional 12 patients will be enrolled and treated at the RP2D for further evaluation of safety and efficacy (standard expansion cohort), and an additional 6 patients will have a tissue evaluation of tumor penetrance after a one-time dose of study drug prior to radiosurgery and surgical resection (Phase 0, tumor penetrance cohort). Tumor response will be assessed, using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with assessment based on the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, and safety will include analysis of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory data. Additionally, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), overall survival, progression-free survival, overall response rate, and patient-reported outcomes will be evaluated. The maximum duration of Part A will be 32 months and Part B,12 months. Funding Source - FDA OOPD",

    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a high grade glioma (brain tumor) that is treated with surgery or biopsy followed by radiotherapy (RT) given daily over 6 weeks with or without an oral chemotherapy. Radiation is targeted to the visible residual tumor on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images plus a large margin of 15 to 30 mm to account for possible cancer cells outside the visible tumor and for potential growth or shifts in tumor position throughout the prolonged RT course. Standard RT uses MRI to create a reference plan (with large margins) and treats that same volume every day. This exposes a large amount of healthy brain tissue to radiation leading to toxicity and reduced quality of life.\n\nA new technology, the MR-Linac, combines an MRI scanner and a Linac (radiation delivery machine) into one unit. This allows for \"adaptive\" RT by obtaining an updated MRI scan each day just prior to treatment, adapting the RT plan to take into account any changes in the tumor or the patient's anatomy on that given day. This allows for a smaller (5 mm) margin on the visible tumor as its position can be tracked daily. The goal of this study is to use adaptive RT with small margins with a two-phase approach to test the impact on local control of the visible tumor compared to the large volumes used with standard non-adaptive RT, as well as impacts on neurocognitive function and quality of life.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase Ib trial tests the safety, best dose, and effectiveness of SONALA-001 in combination with magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), also called sonodynamic therapy, in treating patients with glioblastoma that is growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressive) or that has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Sonodynamic therapy is a non-invasive combination therapy that uses low-intensity ultrasound, such as MRgFUS, to activate a drug, such as SONALA-001, to kill tumor cells. SONALA-001 binds to the tumor and may help the sonodynamic therapy target the tumor. MRgFUS is an image-guided, non-invasive technique that uses high energy ultrasound from the Exablate 4000 Type 2.0 device to kill tumors without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. Giving sonodynamic therapy using SONALA-001 with MRgFUS may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma.",

To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity as assessed by objective response rate (ORR; proportion of patients with complete or partial response) per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) 2.0 guidelines.\n\nII. To evaluate preliminary signals of activity as measured by clinical benefit rate (CBR) (proportion of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease), progression-free survival (PFS), PFS rate at 6 months, and overall survival (OS).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive SONALA-001 intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and undergo transcranial MRgFUS 3-8 hours after infusion on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additionally, patients undergo a computed tomography (CT) of the brain prior to treatment and blood sample collection and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) throughout the study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3 to 6 months for up to 3 years after registration.",

    "brief_summary": "Primary brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression of EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), which is associated with poor prognosis. Several methods of inhibiting this receptor have been tested, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with recurring GBM, intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion of Cetuximab (CTX), at a dose of 250mg/m2 in conjunction with hypofractionated radiation, will be safe and efficacious and prevent tumor progression in patients with recurrent, residual GBM.",

D2C7-IT and 2141-V11 will be delivered sequentially directly into the tumor by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the tumor. Based on phase 1 studies of D2C7-IT alone and D2C7-IT in combination with atezolizumab in adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), the amount of D2C7-IT to be delivered will be 4613.2 ng/mL (36 mL). 2141-V11 will be dose escalated during the study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when used in combination with D2C7-IT.\n\nUpon approval of v.9.0 of the protocol, patients will be eligible to receive D2C7-IT + 2141-V11 (via CED and CPL) with or without prior implantation of Tumor Monorail Device (TMD). Patients will be stratified into the following subgroups:\n\n* Subgroup #1: Patients accrued before Protocol Version v.5.0\n* Subgroup #2: Patients accrued after Protocol Version v.5.0 who did not have a TMD implanted.\n* Subgroup #3: Patients accrued after Protocol Version v.9.0 for whom a TMD implantation was initiated.\n\nPatients who enroll in subgroup #3, once identified as safe to proceed with the TMD (e.g. smaller tumor) and after obtaining their agreement, will receive the TMD approximately 14 days before intracranial D2C7-IT + 2141-V11 infusion in a modified 3+3 design (a minimum of 3 patients and a maximum of 9). All patients who do not meet inclusion criteria for the TMD and/or refuse to receive the TMD, will be treated under subgroup #2 and will proceed directly to CED catheter implantation followed by D2C7-IT + 2141-V11.\n\nFor patients enrolled subgroup #3, an initial 3 patients will be observed for safety before enrolling the next cohort of 3 patients. Intraoperative CT will be performed post implant to ensure device location accuracy and to check for hemorrhage. Prior to CED catheter insertion for D2C7-IT + 2141-V11 infusion, the first tumor/fluid sampling through the TMD will occur. Repeated tumor/fluid sampling via the TMD will occur before every perilymphatic injection of 2141-V11, i.e., approximately 2 weeks (+ 1 week) after D2C7-IT, which will be repeated again 2 weeks later and then every 3 weeks for 1 year. If fewer than 2 of the first 3 patients who receive the TMD experience an unacceptable adverse event within 14 days of TMD implantation, 3 more patients will receive the TMD. The TMD sampling time can be adjusted from every 3 weeks to every 6 weeks (i.e., every other 2141-V11 infusion) if not enough cellular and genomic material is sampled in the first cohort. With protocol version 10.0, patients who have completed 1 year of CPL subcutaneous injections of 2141-V11 at 2.0 mg every 3 weeks, who benefit from the therapy, and desire to continue on therapy will receive CPL subcutaneous injections of 2141-V11 at 2.0 mg every 4-6 weeks.",

    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent glial tumor (glioma). The epidemiology of brain gliomas depends on many factors such as age, gender, genetics, environment, and lifestyle.\n\nAccording to statistics, in developed countries, brain gliomas account for about 2% of all tumors. In the USA, there are approximately 12,000 new cases of brain gliomas annually, and in Europe, there are about 25,000. The average age of individuals diagnosed with brain gliomas is 64 years, although they can occur in all age groups. However, the majority of cases are diagnosed in individuals between 45 and 70 years of age. The global incidence rate is 3.7/100,000 for men and 2.6/100,000 for women. A higher incidence rate is observed in highly industrialized countries. It is estimated that gliomas account for 30 to 40% of all intracranial tumors. Approximately 50% of adult gliomas are the most malignant form - Glioblastoma multiforme G4.\n\nIn 2009, 1444 new cases of malignant brain tumors were recorded in men and 1362 in women in Poland. Men have a slightly higher risk of developing brain gliomas than women. The presence of genetic and hereditary factors, including mutations in genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle control, increases the risk of developing gliomas. Risk factors for the development of gliomas include exposure to ionizing radiation and viral infections (cytomegalovirus), smoking, alcohol abuse, overweight, lack of physical activity, as well as exposure to certain chemicals such as pesticides and solvents.\n\nRecommendations for the treatment of Glioblastoma multiforme include:\n\nSurgical removal of the tumor as the primary method of treatment. Unfortunately, considering the fact that Glioblastoma multiforme is a disease of the entire brain, complete tumor resection is not possible. Therefore, the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy is considered. This treatment is used according to the protocol published by Stupp in 2005.\n\nRadiotherapy: Radiotherapy is used to destroy the remaining tumor cells after the tumor removal. It can be used after surgery or as a standalone treatment, especially in cases where the tumor cannot be surgically removed. The total dose according to the Stupp protocol is 60 Gy and is administered in fractions of 2 Gy per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday) for 6 weeks.\n\nChemotherapy: In the Stupp protocol, temozolomide is used during radiotherapy: 75 mg/m2 of body surface area per day for 7 days a week. After the completion of radiotherapy, temozolomide is used as adjuvant therapy - 6 cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 of body surface area for 5 days every 28 days.\n\nHowever, the clinical effects of using the Stupp protocol are not fully satisfactory. The two-year survival rate after the full Stupp protocol (radio- and chemotherapy) is 26.5% of patients, and after using only radiotherapy, it is 10.4% of patients.\n\nSupportive treatment methods used in the treatment of Glioblastoma multiforme so far include thermotherapy - hyperthermia and nanotherapy.\n\nHyperthermia involves:\n\n* the use of elevated temperature to increase the effectiveness of radio- and chemotherapy\n* thermoablation, in which the use of high temperatures - above 45\u00b0C - causes direct damage to tumor cells,\n* magnetic hyperthermia (MHT), e.g. NanoTherm\u00ae Therapy (NTT), which has been registered in Europe as a method of treating Glioblastoma multiforme in cases of tumor recurrence Nanotherapy uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNP), which are used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\n\nHyperthermia and thermotherapy have been treatment methods studied in cancer patients and magnetic hyperthermia induced using nanoparticles is becoming the subject of increasingly advanced research.\n\nIn a phase III study, the use of tumor-treating fields (TTF) was evaluated as a first-line therapy in patients with Glioblastoma multiforme. Low-power electromagnetic fields using long waves are directed at the tumor area using external electrodes. According to the report from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG), this method resulted in a 5-month extension of the overall survival of patients with Glioblastoma multiforme compared to patients treated with temozolomide, and the tolerance of the treatment was acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, NanoTherm therapy represents a promising form of thermotherapy leading to an extension of survival, especially in cases of Glioblastoma multiforme recurrence. In the study by Maier-Hauff et al., it was shown that the average overall survival of patients undergoing NanoTherm therapy after recurrence was 13.4 months, which was longer (P\\<0.01) than in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol (6.2 months). The overall survival after the initial diagnosis of Glioblastoma multiforme was also longer (23.2 versus 14.6 months; P\\<0.01). The benefit observed in both groups of patients was attributed to the use of NanoTherm therapy.\n\nTherefore, among the sought-after new methods of treating Glioblastoma multiforme that could increase the effectiveness of the current treatment, NanoTherm therapy is a procedure that significantly increases the survival and quality of life of patients. For this reason, it is planned to conduct this study, the aim of which is to determine the effectiveness and tolerance of using nanoparticles in cyclic hyperthermia as adjuvant therapy in patients with Glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nThe main goal of the treatment for each patient with Glioblastoma multiforme is to prolong survival time and improve the quality of life. According to the literature, the median overall survival of these patients is 9 - 12 months.\n\nPatients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme WHO G4 will be included in the ANCHIALE study.\n\nStudy Objective:\n\nThe aim of the ANCHIALE study is to prepare a registry that allows for the evaluation of the efficacy and tolerance of using the NanoTherm therapy system in cases of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nStudy Principles:\n\nDuring the initial visit, a qualification for treatment will be conducted, taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria, i.e., indications and contraindications for the NanoTherm therapy system. Additionally, an interview, neurological examination, and surveys regarding daily functioning and quality of life will be conducted.\n\nAfter qualifying a patient for the study, he or she will undergo standard neurosurgical operation aimed at partial or, if possible, complete removal of the recurrent brain tumor. Then, in the place of the removed tumor, NanoTherm ASI will be administered in a quantity of either 112 or 335 mg/ml of iron particles. This is a sterile suspension of iron oxide nanoparticles in sterile water, characterized by a high specific ability to absorb heat associated with its superparamagnetic properties. At the site where the thickest layer of nanoparticles (NanoTherm\u00ae ASI) is applied, a catheter will be implanted allowing for measurement and control of temperature during the first activation in the magnetic field of the NanoActivator\u00ae.\n\nBetween the 6th and 10th day after the neurosurgical procedure, a standard computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head will be performed for routine postoperative evaluation.\n\nAfter the first activation (10th day post-implantation of NanoTherm\u00ae ASI), the catheter will be removed. Subsequently, cyclically, for 6 times, the patient will be subjected to the variable magnetic field of the NanoActivator\u00ae to induce hyperthermia, i.e., increase the temperature of the site after the removed tumor and the surrounding tissues. Activations will be conducted on the 10th, 14th, 17th, 21st, 24th, and 28th day. The heat released by the nanoparticles (NanoTherm\u00ae ASI) into the surrounding tissue causes destruction or damage to the cells of the glioblastoma multiforme (hyperthermia effect), increasing their susceptibility to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nThe patient will then be subjected to detailed observation for 2 years. Observation will include visits conducted on the 60th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day after surgery, and then every 3 months up to 2 years post-procedure.\n\nOn the 6th - 10th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day after surgery, and then every 3 months up to 2 years post-procedure, a CT scan with an evaluation of treatment efficacy will be performed. The treatment effects on CT will be analyzed using RANO (Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology) scale.\n\nDuring follow-up visits on the 60th, 90th, 150th, 210th, 270th, and 360th day, and then every 3 months up to 2 years after the surgical procedure, a neurological examination, assessment of adverse symptoms, number of potential hospitalizations, number of medical visits, clinimetric assessment regarding quality of life (EuroQuality of Life-5 dimensions 5- levels \\[EQ-5D-5L\\], Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology \\[NanoScale 2\\]), and clinimetric assessment regarding neurological deficit and degree of disability will be conducted (modified Rankin scale, Barthel index).\n\nThe results from NanoTherm group will be compared to patients undergoing standard neurosurgical treatment for the abovementioned effects.",

However, the demonstrated safety profile of this approach is contradictory in the literature and the specific benefits in distinct clinical and molecular patient subgroups remains ill-defined. The aim of this study, therefore, is to compare the effects of resection and best oncological treatment for recurrent glioblastoma as a whole and in clinically important subgroups.\n\nThis study is an international, multicenter, prospective observational cohort study. Recurrent glioblastoma patients will undergo tumor resection or best oncological treatment at a 1:1 ratio as decided by the tumor board. Primary endpoints are: 1) proportion of patients with NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) deterioration at 6 weeks after surgery and 2) overall survival. Secondary endpoints are: 1) progression-free survival (PFS), 2) NIHSS deterioration at 3 months and 6 months after surgery, 3) health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery, and 4) frequency and severity of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in each arm. Estimated total duration of the study is 5 years. Patient inclusion is 4 years, follow-up is 1 year.\n\nThe study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee (METC Zuid-West Holland/Erasmus Medical Center; MEC-2020-0812).

Eligible patients are operated or receive best oncological treatment with a 1:1 ratio with a sequential computer-generated random number as subject ID. Intraoperative mapping techniques and/or surgical adjuncts can be used in both treatment arms to ensure the safety of the resection (to minimize the risk of postoperative deficits).\n\nStudy patients undergo tumor re-resection or receive best oncological treatment and will undergo evaluation at presentation (baseline) and during the follow-up period at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Motor function will be evaluated using the NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) and MRC (Medical Research Council) scale. Language function will be evaluated using a standard neurolinguistic test-battery consisting of the Aphasia Bedside Check (ABC), Shortened Token test, Verbal fluency, Picture description and Object naming. This neurolinguistic test-battery is the result of a consensus between the participating centers. Cognitive function will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Overall patient functioning with be assessed with the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status classification system for comorbidities. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed with the EQ-5D questionnaire and the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20 questionnaires. Overall survival and progression-free survival will be assessed. We expect to complete patient inclusion in 4 years. The estimated duration of the study, including follow-up, will be 5 years.\n\nThe primary study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of re-resection versus best oncological treatment (neurological morbidity and overall survival) in recurrent glioblastoma patients as expressed by NIHSS scores and survival data. Secondary study objectives are to study the overall progressive-free survival (PFS), long-term neurological morbidity (3 months and 6 months postoperatively), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) after resection versus best oncological treatment as expressed by progression on follow up MRI scans based on the RANO criteria24 for tumor progression; NIHSS scores, quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ BN20, EQ-5D), and registration of SAEs.\n\nPatients will be recruited for the study from the neurosurgical or neurological outpatient clinic or through referral from general hospitals of the participating neurosurgical hospitals of the ENCRAM Research Consortium, located in Europe and the United States.",

    "brief_summary": "Coagulation is a complex system which, through the action of thrombin, leads to the formation of fibrin, which stabilises the platelet clot. Any disturbance in the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant factors can tip the physiological process either towards a state of hypercoagulability leading to thrombosis or hypocoagulability responsible for bleeding.\n\nDue to a number of factors, cancer is associated with a state of hypercoagulability, leading to thrombosis. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients varies from 15 to 20% depending on the type of cancer, the stage of the disease and the associated treatments (ONCORIF data, November 2021). The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is greatly increased in cancer patients (RR x 3 to 6) and doubled in the case of associated chemotherapy (1). VTE is a poor prognostic factor, occurs mainly in the first 6 months after diagnosis and is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients.\n\nAt present, haemostasis tests performed in medical laboratories independently explore the different coagulation pathways but do not allow the overall haemostatic profile of a hyper- or hypocoagulable patient to be assess.\n\nBased on this knowledge base, the aim of our study will be to monitor thrombogram profiles during the management of patients with tumours at high risk of thromboembolism (lung, pancreas, stomach, glioblastoma) and to correlate these profiles with the risk of a thromboembolic event occurring in these patients. The aim of the project is to validate a simple predictive test (suitable for clinical use) for the risk of thromboembolism in these patients. These analyses will also make it possible to monitor the impact of chemotherapy on changes in the thrombin generation test in patients.",

Experimental evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play a key role in the malignancy of these tumors. In fact, due to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, these cells are able to create compensatory pathways that confer stem-like, angiogenic and pro-tumoral functions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that brain tumor stem cells are radio- and chemo-resistant and therefore not treatable with the therapeutic protocols currently in use. To date, in fact, there are no definitive treatments for the eradication of brain tumors. In this scenario, sphingolips, a class of lipid deputized to several physiological functions, are also involved in tumor onset, progression, drug resistance, and aggressiveness. In hypoxic tumor microenvironment, CSCs present a modified rheostat in the metabolism of sphingolipid, in favor of Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).\n\nS1P is an intermediate of sphingolipid metabolism, formed from sphingosine through the action of sphingosine kinases (SK). Increasing evidence suggests that S1P acts as a tumor-promoting signal, predominantly in the extracellular environment, regulating important cellular properties correlated with tumor potential.\n\nThe project aims to identify new molecular and metabolic targets involved in the survival and chemo-resistance of tumor stem cells in relation to the tumor microenvironment.",
    "detailed_description": "Tumors of the central nervous system affect 21 people per 100,000 every year, a figure that refers to countries with advanced economies, with an increase in incidence over time. Among tumors of the central nervous system, Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive malignant tumor with an average life expectancy of approximately 12 months and a survival of less than 5% in the following 5 years to the diagnosis. The growth and progression of GBM are dependent on a specialized subpopulation of tumor cells called \"cancer stem cells\" (CSCs). CSCs are chemo- and radio-resistant, are responsible for relapses and therefore should constitute an important target of therapeutic strategies, but the mechanisms underlying their biology are still poorly understood. Hypoxia, through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and sphingolipid pathway, plays a key role in the control of tumor growth and angiogenesis and represents, perhaps, the most effective adaptation mechanism of the tumor itself. Indeed, The hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors gives them greater aggressiveness, an increase in the expression of proteins linked to angiogenesis, anaerobic energy metabolism and adaptation to oxidative stress which facilitates the onset and proliferation of CSCs.\n\nThis study supports the evidence that the hypoxic microenvironment regulates the state of CSCs, and therefore influencing the response to the current pharmacological treatments.\n\nAlthough S1P can act as an intracellular second messenger, most of its effects are exerted as an extracellular mediator, through binding to specific G protein-coupled receptors, originally known as EDGs and now called S1P receptors (S1PRs). Our group has previously demonstrated that acquired modifications in the metabolism of sphingolipids, in particular in the regulation of S1P, are able to confer stem-like and chemo-resistance properties to CSCs in patients with GBM.\n\nThe project aims to identify new molecular and metabolic targets involved in the survival and chemo-resistance of tumor stem cells in relation to the tumor microenvironment.\n\nThrough the study of sphingolipid metabolism, new markers and inhibitors will be identified to be delivered to inhibit CSC proliferation and tumor progression.\n\nWith this approach the investigators will be able to evaluate how the tumor microenvironment and the molecular and metabolic characteristics of the tumor influence cellular communication and whether this process can be influenced by new pharmacological treatments. This study could highlight new pathways and tumor-specific alterations to stratify new therapeutic strategies and to identify new potential biomarkers in diagnosis and monitoring, thus improving the prognosis of patients suffering from brain tumors.",

Every year 1000 patients are diagnosed with this disease in the Netherlands. Despite neurosurgery, chemo -and radiation therapy, these tumors inevitably recur. Currently, there is no gold standard at time of recurrence and treatment options are limited. In a retrospective study in two Dutch neuro-oncology centers, the overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent GBM receiving best supportive care was 3 months, while patients receiving systemic treatment (usually nitrosurea), radiation therapy or surgery followed by systemic treatment or radiotherapy had respectively 7.3 months, 9.2 months and 11 months OS. Unfortunately, the results of dedicated trials with new drugs have been very disappointing. For those to be meaningful, extensive molecular screening is needed.\n\nThe goal of the project is to obtain the evidence for changing standard of care procedures to include extensive molecular diagnostics and consequently adapt care guidelines for this specific patient group with very poor prognosis by offering optimal and timely benefit from novel therapies, even in the absence of traditional registration trials for this small volume cancer indication.\n\nObjective: To determine the value of and generate the clinical evidence for routine application of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)-based diagnostics and targeted therapy guidance for glioblastoma patients at time of first recurrence.\n\nStudy design: Prospective diagnostic multicenter cohort study Study population: Adult glioblastoma patients with recurrent disease that are undergoing resection or debulking as part of their standard care and from whom written informed consent is obtained.\n\nIntervention: A 10 mL blood sample will be drawn once to assess each patient's germline DNA background variation that will discriminate somatic mutations from the patient's germline DNA background variations. All other interventional procedures required to perform this study are part of standard procedures.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints:\n\nPrimary study endpoint: Overall survival\n\nSecondary study endpoints:\n\n* Tumor and blood collection success rate (target \\>85% of all patients included)\n* Number of successful WGS reports (reports for \\>80% of patients for which tumor material was collected)\n* Number of targeted treatment options identified (at least one potentially actionable DNA alteration in \\>75% of patients with a WGS report)\n* Number of experimental treatments available for GBM patients (relevant (off-label) drugs for at least 50% of the identified indications should be available through a study, including the Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP)\n* Thirty-two percent of patients starting a targeted treatment in presence of actionable variant (currently 16%)",

    "brief_summary": "Current standard of care therapy and all FDA approved adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma continue to provide less than 12 months of progression free survival (PFS) and less than 24 months of overall survival (OS). There is an extreme need for any novel therapy against glioblastoma that increases progression free survival and overall survival in patients diagnosed with this invasive form of cancer. A significant reason for such a poor prognosis is the infiltrative nature of this tumor in non-enhancing regions (NE) beyond the central contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of tumor, which is difficult to visualize and treat with surgical, medical, or radiotherapeutic means.\n\nSince tumor cells exhibit abnormal metabolic behavior leading to extracellular acidification, we theorize a newly developed pH-sensitive MRI technique called amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echoplanar imaging (CEST-EPI) may identify infiltrating NE tumor beyond what is clear on standard MRI with gadolinium contrast. This phase I safety study will use use intraoperative CEST-EPI guided resections in glioblastoma at increasing distances from areas of CE tumor to test whether this technique is safe and can remove additional areas of infiltrative NE tumor.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI guided resections for glioblastoma.The secondary objectives of this study include:\n\n1. A preliminary efficacy analysis of CEST-EPI guided resections in extending progression free and overall survival.\n2. To confirm that resected tissue obtained from pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI guided resections contain infiltrating NE tumor.\n\nThe primary endpoint for this study will be safety of resecting \"CEST positive\", acidic regions within T2 hyperintense regions of glioblastoma thought to contain active NE tumor at increasing distances from contrast enhancing tumor with development of a recommended maximal tolerated resection.\n\n1. At the maximal tolerated resection, a preliminary efficacy study with endpoints of progression free survival (as defined by RANO Resect 2.0) 1 and overall survival.\n2. Quantitation of infilitrating tumor burden on CEST-EPI resected tissue using immunohistochemical staining.\n\n12 patients up to 24 patients based on resection limiting toxicities with potential expansion of up to 16 patients at the maximum tolerated resection.\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

    "detailed_description": "This is a single center, single arm, phase 1 surgical dose escalation clinical trial with a preliminary efficacy study at the recommended safe maximal resection. Total duration of subject participation will be two years. Total duration of the study is expected to be 5 years.\n\nPatients with suspected newly diagnosed or recurrent isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type (IDH-WT) glioblastoma will be enrolled in this study if within the selection criteria (see inclusion and exclusion criteria below). Prior to surgery, patients will undergo: 1) standard pre-operative medical clearance 2) standard of care pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 34 with gadolinium contrast with thin cut T1 with and without contrast and diffusion tensor imaging and 3) amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echoplanar (CEST-EPI) MRI. 3,18,19,33 Pre-operative post-processing of CEST-EPI regions to identify areas of potential infiltrating tumor will be carried out as previously described. 3 In addition, resection constraints will be added based (starting at 0.7cm and increasing in 0.7cm intervals over 4 intervals to a maximum constraint of 2.8cm). This maximum constraint will reach the theorized threshold for significant infiltrating tumor cell burden based on preliminary data. 3,14 This data will be converted into a intraoperative object through our intraoperative neuronavigation system (BrainLab Surgical Navigation System, Munich, Germany).\n\nOn day of surgery, subjects will undergo standard of care procedures for craniotomy for brain tumor resection at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Upon initial tumor resection, a biopsy specimen will be sent to neuro-pathology to confirm diagnosis. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a safe FDA approved fluorescence molecule used to increase extent of resection in glioma surgery will be administered for comparision with CEST imaging in surgery. 17 Areas of 5-ALA positivity and areas of CEST-EPI positivity will be biopsied for further comparision as described in the secondary objective. This will be followed by resection using the intraoperative CEST-EPI identified region with resection constraint using the intraoperative neuronavigation object. After completion of surgery, standard of care procedures for craniotomy will be completed.\n\nTo assess for short and long term complications related to surgery alone, patients will be admitted post-operatively with standard post-op care. There will be a immediate within 24-hr MRI while patient is inpatient, followed by 2 week post-operative visit alongside a 4 week MRI 35 to evaluate for rapid early progression. This will be followed with standard of care 8 week MRI and initiation of standard of care (temolozolomide and radiotherapy). The window of monitoring for surgery related complications will be the 4 week MRI and office visit as the resection limiting toxicities (described below) all fall within this window.\n\nGiven this protocol, safety constraints and analysis will follow a pre-determined statistical and methodological protocol. Using standard of care resection of contrast enhancement as the baseline, we will begin with 3 subjects with maximal CEST positive resection 0.7 cm from the contrast enhancing edge. The resection levels up to (0.7cm, 1.4 cm, 2.1cm or 2.8cm) from areas of CE tumor (\"doses\") escalation within each cohort will occur following a rule-based approach based on a i3+3 design 2 with a target resection level limiting toxicity (RLT) probability of 0.25 and an equivalence interval (EI) of 0.20 to 0.30, meaning that the RLT rate must not exceed the upper bound of the equivalence interval (EI) in order to extend the distance from contrast enhancing edge or for a distance to be selected for validation/expansion in \"dose\" escalation (if already at the highest dose level). Given that variability in the data can be large in a small cohort, the i3+3 design requires 2 criteria are met when determining whether to stay at the current distance or to reduce. First, the RLT rate must exceed the upper bound of the EI (ie, \u22651 RLTs occur in 3 patients). Next, if subtracting 1 from the number of RLTs results in a RLT rate within the EI, then the i3+3 rules state to stay at the current level and enroll 3 additional patients (Note: if a cohort in Dose Escalation is expanded to 6 patients and the adjusted RLT rate remains within the EI, this dose may be further expanded/validated in dose expansion following discussion with the Independent Data Monitoring Committee \\[IDMC\\]/Safety Monitoring Committee \\[SMC\\]). However, if the adjusted RLT rate still exceeds the EI, the rules state to enroll 3 patients at the next lower level.\n\nDecision Rule Table (source https://i3design.shinyapps.io/i3plus3/) :\n\nFollowing the completion of resection level escalation, a recommended maximum resection (MR) will be calculated using all available RLT data. The recommended MR will be calculated using an isotonic regression. Under this framework, the MR is the resection for which the isotonic estimate of the RLT rate is closest to the target RLT rate of 0.25. The recommended MR or a lower recommended level will be selected as the primary recommendation or resection.\n\nAs a secondary objective, if the MR is greater than the standard of care resection, (the DSMB recommendation is that a certain interval of CEST-EPI resection is safe) the MR will be used for a single-arm preliminary efficacy analysis compared to propensity matched historical controls of resection of IDH-WT GBM. If this expansion is carried out, we will carry out CEST-EPI resections at the MR in 16 patients using the same protocol and follow up as described above. Follow up will additionally include interval MRI as recommended by RANO 2.0 1 to calculated PFS and OS. Comparisions with historical controls will be carried out with cox regression analyses.\n\nAs additional secondary data, an objective measure of tumor burden will be evaluated. Tumor tissue will be collected from each resection. The secondary endpoint of this study is to determine the dependence of pH-sensitive amine CEST-EPI contrast on \"active\" tumor density. This will be measured through immunohistochemical staning of tumor (via H\\&E, anti-EGFR for EGFR amplified tumors), and proliferative tumor (anti-Ki67) which will be reviewed by blinded neuro-pathologist. Comaprisions of tumor burden across CEST-EPI and 5-ALA metrics will be compared with paired sample chi square tests and linear regression analysis. A study timeline is shown below.\n\n5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint for this study will be the safety of resecting CEST-EPI positive regions of glioblastoma.\n\n5.2 Safety Evaluations This is an additional risk study and all safety evaluations will be reviewed as described below by JCCC DSMB and at multidisciplinary brain tumor board including neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, neuro-radiologists, and neuro-pathologists. Safety will be evaluated by \"resection limited toxicities\" (RLTs) and are pre-defined and are listed in detail below.",

Glioblastoma is the most common brain cancer in adults and survival rates remain poor despite treatment including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. EGFR is a protein found on the surface of some cells, to which epidermal growth factor binds, causing the cells to divide. It is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of tumor cells, so these cells may divide excessively in the presence of epidermal growth factor. ERAS-801, an EGFR inhibitor that can penetrate the central nervous system, binds to the tumor cells that express EGFR and may help shrink or slow the growth of the tumor cells.",

    "detailed_description": "Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is an advanced imaging technique that measures the mechanical properties of tissues, providing valuable information about tissue stiffness, elasticity, and adhesion. In the case of gliomas, a type of brain tumor arising from glial cells, MRE has shown promising potential in the diagnosis, classification, and prediction of pathological and molecular features.\n\nThis clinical trial aims to investigate the relationship between tumor stiffness, adhesion, glioma grading, and genetic alterations by combining magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) imaging findings with molecular pathological analysis. Moreover, the study aims to predict patient survival based on the physical properties of the tumor.\n\nPreoperatively, we will use MRE to enhance the accuracy of navigation and determine tumor stiffness and adhesion properties. Intraoperatively, under the guidance of neuronavigation, tissue samples will be obtained, and the operating surgeon will assess the tumor's stiffness, elasticity, and degree of adhesion.\n\nPostoperatively, all tissue specimens will undergo molecular pathological analysis. The integration of MRE findings with molecular pathology data will enable precise classification and subtyping of gliomas.\n\nFurthermore, all patients will receive systematic treatment after surgery, and long-term follow-ups will be conducted. This comprehensive approach combining MRE, molecular pathology analysis, and clinical follow-up aims to investigate the predictive value of MRE in terms of molecular pathological features and prognosis in gliomas.",

Those previously treated with indoximod plus temozolomide may be eligible, including prior treatment via the phase 2 indoximod study (GCC1949, NCT04049669), the now closed phase 1 study (NLG2105, NCT02502708), or any expanded access (compassionate use) protocols. A dose-escalation cohort will determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib for the 4-drug combination. This will be followed by an expansion cohort, using ibrutinib at the best safe dose in the 4-drug combination, to allow assessment of preliminary evidence of efficacy.",

During viral replication, IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody are expressed and secreted into the tumor microenvironment, acting synergistically by increasing the T cell infiltration, converting the cold (immune suppressing) tumor to hot (immune active) tumor, and inducing anti-tumor specific immunity. This study is investigating if oHSV1 MVR-C5252 administered via CED can overcome the BBB (Blood Brain Barrier) in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.

    "detailed_description": "The annual incidence rate of malignant brain tumors in China is 4.2/100000, and GBM accounts for 50.9%. GBM is highly invasive and malignant. After undergoing anti-tumor treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the short-term recurrence rate is extremely high. The median survival time after recurrence is only 9 months, and the 1-year survival rate is 30%. It is urgent to explore new therapy strategy.\n\nTransgenic oncolytic virus therapy for GBM is an emerging anti-tumor therapy. The genetically engineered oncolytic virus has improved selectivity towards tumor cells, replicating and lysing only within infected tumor cells, while activating the body's immune system to launch a more extensive attack on tumors. At present, various genetically modified oncolytic viruses targeting GBM have entered the clinical trial stage both domestically and internationally. For example, G47\u0394, with superior anti-tumor activity and good safety in early clinical trials, has been conditionally approved for marketing in Japan for the treatment of malignant gliomas. DNX-2401, JL15003, and others are also in the early stages of clinical research. NRG-103 is an innovative gene therapy drug developed based on the in situ trans-differentiation technology. Through multiple mutation modifications of the adenovirus genome, it can enhance the specific recognition and killing effect of oncolytic virus on GBM tumor cells without being limited by tumor gene phenotype, and regulate the immune microenvironment to induce stronger anti-tumor immune response. In addition, the two transcription factors expressed on NRG-103 can efficiently transdifferentiate residual GBM tumor cells into non tumor like neuronal cells, in order to achieve the goal of delaying tumor recurrence and long-term survival. NRG-103 exhibits significant anti-tumor activity and clear in situ trans-differentiation effects in preclinical models, providing scientific evidence for the potential clinical efficacy of NRG-103.",

    "brief_summary": "Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, representing at least 75% of all primary malignant brain tumors. Histopathologically, gliomas are classified into different subgroups including astrocytomas (60-70%), oligodendrogliomas (10-30%), ependymomas (\\<10%) and mixed gliomas (i.e. oligoastrocytomas) depending on the cell type from which they originate. The World Health Organization currently classifies gliomas based on histopathological analysis in which the presence (or absence) and the degree of specific histopathological features determines the grade of malignancy. Grade I (pilocytic astrocytoma) and grade II (diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligoastrocytoma, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma) are termed low-grade gliomas (LGGs), whereas grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma) and grade IV (glioblastoma) represent high-grade gliomas (HGGs).\n\nGiven the incurable nature of gliomas, the maintenance or improvement of the patient's quality of life are extremely important. The benefits of multimodal treatment strategies, in terms of prolonged survival or delay of progression, have to be carefully balanced against the side effects of the treatment, which may adversely influence patient's functioning and well-being during his/her remaining life span.\n\nMeasuring a brain tumor patients functioning and well-being goes far beyond assessing (progression-free) survival or tumor response to treatment on imaging. A more integrated way to measure patients functioning and well-being is the assessment of a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL). HRQOL is defined as a personal self-assessed ability to function in the physical, psychological, emotional, and social domains of day-to-day life.\n\nThe main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma.",
    "detailed_description": "Aims of the study\n\nThe main goal of this study is to perform a large-scale, prospective and long-term analysis of the HRQOL in patients diagnosed with glioma and to set up a database which contains general patient characteristics, tumor information, treatment strategy and follow-up data of each included patient. This large-scale database will allow the investigator to investigate several relevant research questions in a well-documented group of glioma patients.\n\nMethodology\n\nHRQOL is a multidimensional concept covering physical, psychological and social domains as well as symptoms induced by the disease and the treatment. Currently there is no single gold standard tool to measure HRQOL, and several valid measures of HRQOL in brain tumor patients are available. In this study the investigator will use the EQ-5D questionnaire to report patient's HRQOL. The EQ-5D is widely used and has been validated in many different patient populations. It has been designed so that patients can describe the extent to which they have a problem in each of the five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression The timing of the HRQOL questionnaires will depend on whether a patient will be diagnosed with either a LGG or a HGG. Moreover, as the current treatment strategies for LGG patients and for relapsed HGG patients are highly variable, the investigator scheduled the HRQOL measurements not in function of the treatment, but rather in function of the classical, standard-of-care patient follow-up (either 3 or 6 monthly).\n\nMissing data\n\nWhen there are missing data for some patients, the question arises as to whether patients with missing data differ from those who returned completed forms. As a consequence, missing data presents problems in the analysis and the interpretation of the results. Hence, the amount of missing data should be minimized. A regular check on missing data will be performed by the CTA. In case the HRQOL form was not completed by the included patient, the patient will be contacted by phone or e-mail and he/she will be asked to provide an answer to the different questions of the HRQOL questionnaire in order to avoid missing data. In case the patient is unable to complete the HRQOL questionnaire, the CTA will report the reason for non-completion in the database.",

    "brief_summary": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain tumor in adults. The strikingly poor survival for patients with GBM (average survival 14-16 months following diagnosis) is due in part to limited early detection methods and an absence of effective therapeutic options. The study proposed would establish important evidence for the use of Health Canada approved drugs such as amantadine as a safe, effective and affordable way to monitor GBM. The method is based on the overproduction of a key enzyme in GBM cells called spermine/ spermidine n-acetyl transferase (SSAT1). The increased SSAT1 expression in GBM results in increased metabolism of the drug which is detected in the blood or urine of patients with GBM. The levels of acetyl-amantadine captured will be correlated with the tumor burden as seen on the MRIs of these patients. Thus, the study aims to determine the usefulness of amantadine as a diagnostic biomarker for GBM.",
    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with a median age of onset of 55 to 60 years. Most patients are treated with postoperative radiation and chemotherapy following their initial surgery. For newly diagnosed, high grade gliomas, the first post-radiation cycle of temozolomide (an oral chemotherapy drug) typically begins four weeks after completion of radiation therapy1. During radiation, temozolomide or lomustine is given daily (seven days per week). Assessment of response and progression is made through brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, which is typically obtained within one month after completion of radiation therapy and then every two months during adjuvant temozolomide to assess disease status1. With the available standard of care, the median overall survival of patients with glioblastoma remains very low - approximately 10 to 12 months2.\n\nThe poor prognosis with GBM is a result of an absence of early detection and ineffective treatment options. The proposed exploratory pilot project attempts to addresses the problem of accurate tumor progression monitoring in GBM through the development of a drug biomarker that monitors spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) activity. SSAT1 is an important enzyme involved in polyamine regulation in the cell. As polyamines are essential for tumor proliferation, SSAT1 is over-expressed in many different cancers, as shown in a number of non-clinical trials3,4,5. These trials provide a rationale for our project: if SSAT1 is overexpressed in cancers including glioblastoma, then a substrate of SSAT1 could serve as a biomarker for determining the cellular activity of SSAT1. An effective substrate is amantadine, and following its acetylation by SSAT1, N-acetyl-amantadine levels excreted in the blood and urine samples of patients with glioblastoma could be used to indicate the presence of upregulation of SSAT1, and therefore, indicative of cancer. Recently published clinical trials involving investigators here at University of Manitoba and CancerCare Manitoba have reported a method for assessing tumor progression in lung and breast cancer patients based on acetyl- amantadine levels in blood and urine6,7,8. The assay is predicated on the selective acetylation of the drug amantadine by SSAT1. Published studies indicate increases in acetyl-amantadine in blood and urine from patients receiving a single oral dose of amantadine was predictive of tumor burden. Tappia et.al.7 reported that human cancer is associated with high urinary concentration of acetyl-amantadine with receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) for acetyl-amantadine demonstrated to be 0.689 (CI: 0.591-0.786, 95%) in lung cancer and 0.717 (CI: 0.577-0.858, 95%) for breast cancer.\n\nGiven the use of acetyl-amantadine as an early biomarker for lung and breast cancer, the present study protocol examines the extent to which acetyl-amantadine levels in blood and urine can be used to detect glioblastoma progression, particularly tumor recurrence which happens in the majority of patients and is considered inevitable after a median survival time of 32 - 36 weeks1. There are currently no studies that have attempted to determine the diagnostic value of acetyl-amantadine in glioblastoma patients, and therefore, this would be a pilot project. Under this protocol, patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (newly or recurrent) who are following the standard of care (surgical resection and radiation/chemotherapy) will be enrolled in the study. An initial assessment of the participant's baseline acetyl-amantadine levels in blood will be determined at the first visit. Thereafter, participants will be administered a standard 200 mg dose of the Health Canada approved drug amantadine at every visit in which MRI based imaging assessments are being performed (typically, every 8 - 12 weeks). Blood and urine samples will be taken at each visit to assay for acetyl-amantadine levels. These resulting acetyl-amantadine levels will be correlated with MRI based image findings to determine the extent to which this biomarker can be used for treatment monitoring in glioblastoma patients.\n\nWhile the hypothesis is that acetyl-amantadine levels in blood or urine can be used to track tumor progression, an increase in acetyl-amantadine level would not indicate per se what type of tumor was present. For this reason, a metabolic profile on blood and urine samples collected from glioblastoma patients will be performed, to determine if there is a metabolic signature that can be established for glioblastoma.",

    "detailed_description": "RT is fundamental in the treatment of primary brain tumours. RT contributes to improved local control and prolonged progression-free survival in patients with a broad range of tumour types. Irradiation to the normal brain may lead to cognitive impairments. Clarifying the nature and severity of impairment in adult RT-treated brain tumour patients, including region-specific effects, are important for optimal utilization of novel conformal RT technologies such as proton therapy.\n\nThe study is a prospective nationwide study including approximately 300 brain tumour patients from the Danish Center of Particle Therapy and the four Neuro Oncology Centers in Denmark.\n\nThe patients will be assessed with a comprehensive battery of standardized cognitive tests and complete a questionnaire (PRO's). They will do this prior to RT treatment and 1, 3, 5 and 10 years afterwards. The PRO's includes measures on quality of life, fatigue, sleep, depression, anxiety, and socio demographics. The standardized tests are: Trail making Test (TMT); Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT); Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) - Animals and S; Coding and Digit Span from WAIS-IV. The correlation between cognitive scores and RT dose-volume parameters to specific areas in the brain will be tested.\n\nThis study will elucidate the dose-response relationship in radiation-induced damage to substructures of the brain such as hippocampus, thalamus, temporal and frontal lobes that will allow the clinician to prioritize these structures in planning of proton radiotherapy.",

This treatment demonstrated a significant increase in median OS compared to surgery and radiotherapy alone (14.6 vs 12.1 months).\n\nSince 2005, despite several of phase III clinical trials conducted, TTFields treatment was the first to report a significant improvement in GBM patients' survival compared to the previous standard of care. This pivotal phase III clinical trial randomized 695 patients with newly diagnosed GBM receiving either TTFields plus maintenance TMZ or TMZ alone, after completion of standard radiochemotherapy. Adding TTFields to maintenance TMZ significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) and median OS compared to TMZ alone. Impact of TTFields on survival appeared comparable to that achieved by the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy.\n\nThese results led to FDA approval of Optune Gio\u00ae and to CE mark in the European Union in association with maintenance TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, after surgery and radiotherapy with adjuvant TMZ. Optune Gio\u00ae obtained national reimbursement in several European countries in this indication, as Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and France. The National Commission for the Evaluation of Medical Devices and Health Technologies (CNEDiMTS) issued on 20 July 2021 a positive opinion to Optune Gio\u00ae for inclusion into the reimbursement list in the following indication: \"in association with maintenance TMZ, after surgery and radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, as part of a shared decision between the patient and the medical team\".\n\nThis prospective multicenter non-interventional study (NIS) aims at confirming the survival benefit of Optune Gio\u00ae - in terms of OS and PFS - and describing device usage (compliance will be measured through patient's usage report, recorded by each device) and impact on QoL, in a real-life setting in France, in a large cohort of participants with newly diagnosed GBM who completed radiotherapy and concomitant TMZ after surgery and initiating treatment with Optune Gio\u00ae device together with maintenance TMZ.\n\nA special emphasis will be given to the evaluation of QoL and the impact of Optune Gio\u00ae on daily life, considering the limited life expectancy of these patients, the symptom burden and significant disease-related disability.",

    "detailed_description": "Recurrent glioblastoma represents one of the highest unmet medical needs in oncology. Overall prognosis remains poor for patients on standard of care therapies, with a 2-year survival rate of \\< 20%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have the potential to meet this unmet medical need, however such therapies have yet to be fully explored in clinical trials powered for efficacy nor in the neoadjuvant setting. The interplay between the immune system and glioblastoma is complex and shaped by a variety of factors. Certain molecular factors that suggest a promising response to immunotherapies, in non-CNS tumors, paradoxically indicate a worse response in glioblastoma. Atezolizumab has shown several properties that make it an ideal candidate for further investigation in rGBM. Interestingly, a low tumor mutational burden has been implicated in T cell inflammation and immunotherapy outcome in rGBM patients treated with atezolizumab.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will determine whether neoadjuvant atezolizumab therapy provides a therapeutic benefit for patients with recurrent glioblastoma and a low mutational burden. Biological assessments of specimens collected in this trial will test the relationship between low TMB and features associated with immune-editing in rGBM. The investigators hypothesize that a low tumor mutational burden identifies immunologically engaged rGBM tumors and correlates with features previously linked to ICI response. By extensively studying the molecular factors influencing the response to immunotherapy, our goal is to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies in patients with glioblastoma.",

    "brief_summary": "Primary brain cancer kills up to 10,000 Americans a year. These brain tumors are typically treated by surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, either individually or in combination. Present therapies are inadequate, as evidenced by the low 5-year survival rate for brain cancer patients, with median survival at approximately 12 months. Glioma is the most common form of primary brain cancer, afflicting approximately 7,000 patients in the United States each year. These highly malignant cancers remain a significant unmet clinical need in oncology. GBM often has a high expression EFGR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) which is blocked by Cetuximab (CTX). The investigators have recently completed a separate Phase I clinical trial using superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion (SIACI) of CTX after blood brain barrier disruption (BBBD) for recurrent GBM (Chakraborty et al, in revision, Journal of Neurooncology). The investigators found that intra-arterial infusion of CTX is well tolerated with few adverse effects. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, repeated SIACI of this drug after BBBD will be safe and efficacious for our patients when combined with standard chemoradiation (STUPP protocol).\n\nThis trial will be a non-randomized open label Phase I/II clinical trial. In addition to standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy (STUPP protocol) the patient will be given CTX intra-arterially after BBBD for a total of three doses at approximately post surgery days 30, 120 and 210.",

    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor response to existing therapies.\n* Data from the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) and from the literature support that metastatic cancers are potentially immunogenic and that tumor-infiltrating\n\nlymphocytes (TIL) can be grown and expanded from these tumors.\n\n* In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when administered to an autologous patient with high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen.\n* The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic melanoma patients, has led to objective response rates comparable to previous trials relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities.\n* In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.\n* We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer therapy in combination with pembrolizumab, administered either prior to cell administration or at the time of progressive disease, for metastatic cancers.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-Primary objective:\n\n--With Amendment BB, to determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer who receive autologous, minimally cultured TIL in conjunction with a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen, high-dose aldesleukin, and anti-PD-1.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients must be/have:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 72 years\n* Metastatic upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or endocrine tumors including neuroendocrine tumors refractory to standard chemotherapy\n\nPatients may not have:\n\n* Concurrent major medical illnesses\n* Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden\n* Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding\n* Any form of immunodeficiency\n* Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients may undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in the NCI-SB cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).\n* With the approval of Amendment BB, patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 or Arm 4. All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by the infusion of autologous TIL and high-dose aldesleukin. Patients enrolled on Arm 3 will receive pembrolizumab prior to cell administration and three additional doses every three weeks following the cell infusion. Patients enrolled on Arm 4 will receive pembrolizumab within four weeks after meeting progressive disease by RECIST criteria, continuing for up to 8 doses every 3 weeks.\n* Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 6 weeks after cell infusion and periodically thereafter.\n* Twenty-one patients will initially be enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical response (partial response or complete response), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response.\n* Up to 332 patients may be enrolled.",

    "brief_summary": "Currently, the optimal treatment regimen for elderly Glioblastoma (GBM) patients with poor performance status (PS) is unknown. Based on data for elderly GBM patients and the limited data for patients with poor PS, hypofractionated RT or a short course of Temozolomide (TMZ) may provide survival benefit without the added toxicity and inconvenience of a more protracted treatment regimen.\n\nIn particular, treatment with RT or TMZ monotherapy on the basis of methylated O6 - methyl guanine - DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, followed by the alternative therapy at progression, may provide a safe and effective treatment regimen for patients with poor PS.\n\nThe hypothesis of this trial is that in elderly GBM patients with poor performance status (age \u2265 65 years and KPS 50-70), a biomarker-guided approach to therapy results in non-inferior overall survival compared to combined TMZ/RT.\n\nSpecifically, biomarker-guided therapy will consist of TMZ monotherapy for patients with a methylated MGMT promoter, and hypofractionated RT (40 Gy in 15 fractions) for patients with a non-methylated MGMT promoter.\n\nIt is hypothesized that biomarker-guided therapy will result in non-inferior progression-free survival, reduced toxicity and increased cost-effectiveness compared to combined chemoradiotherapy.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\n\u2022 To compare overall survival of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy in elderly and frail patients with newly diagnosed GBM.\n\nSecondary objective:\n\n* To evaluate progression-free survival following treatment in both arms.\n* To evaluate adverse events according to CTCAE criteria in both arms.\n* To evaluate health-related quality-of-life as assessed by MoCA and EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-BN20 questionnaires in both arms.\n* To evaluate cost-effectiveness of standard vs biomarker-guided therapy\n\nMethods:\n\nPatients will be randomized to two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Standard Arm: TMZ with concurrent RT (combined modality arm) Patients will receive 15 days of TMZ daily with concurrent RT. TMZ will be delivered at a dose of 75 mg/m2, given daily with RT. TMZ will be administered 1 hour before each session of RT.\n\nAfter a 4-week break, patients will receive six cycles of adjuvant TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days, up to 6 cycles as tolerated by the patient. The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events, intractable nausea or fatigue.\n\nInvestigational Arm: Biomarker based treatment MGMT (+): TMZ monotherapy Patients will receive TMZ at a dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 15 days on weekdays (Monday through Friday). This will be followed by six cycles of TMZ according to the standard 5-day schedule (days 1-5) every 28 days. The dose will be 150 mg/m2 for the first cycle and increased to 200 mg/m2 beginning with the second cycle, so long as there are no hematologic adverse events. Dose will be determined using the body surface area (BSA) calculation.\n\nMGMT methylation (-): No TMZ will be given. Participants will receive radiation treatment with 40Gy / 15 fractions over a period of 21 days (3 weeks).\n\nUpon treatment completion, participants will be followed by every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for years 3-5.

    "detailed_description": "The patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have high mortality and morbidity. Even with best conventional therapy (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy), the most of median survivals are less than 2 years. The one-year progression-free survival (PFS) is less than 20%. Recently, the immune therapy is a new promising therapy for GBM from the evidences of published experimental data and clinical trials.\n\nHowever, the outcomes of immune therapy are still equivocal. The critical point of immune therapy is strongly influenced by tumor microenvironment. Up to now, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitor such as programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was found to induce exhaustion of CD8 T cell by of PD-1/PD-L1 reaction. Unfortunately, GBM cells always have high PD-L1 expression. It means the higher PD-1 level of T-cell indicates the higher immune suppression by GBM tumor cells.\n\nIn the investigators preclinical study, the best murine survival was found to be the combination outcome of dendritic cell (DC) with anti-PD-1 therapy which was better than that of DC therapy only. From previously ADCV-treated patients, the median of PD-1/CD8 was 0.21. When the PD-1/CD8 ratio less than 0.21, this patient is defined as with low PD-1 level.\n\nFrom the investigators previous experience, patients with low PD-1/CD8 ratio had far better 2-year overall survival (OS) than patients with high PD-1/CD8 ratio in ADCV treatment. On the other hand, it showed that OS and PFS had significant reverse correlation with PD-1 level of Tcell during DC immunotherapy. Considering the needs and benefit of patients, the new autologous dendritic cell vaccine (ADCV01) is proposed to be added on conventional therapy in low PD-1 expressed GBM patients and evaluate its safety and efficacy.\n\nIn this study, only newly diagnosed primary GBM (wild-type Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1, IDH-1) patients will be enrolled in this clinical trial. In addition to fulfilling all inclusion criteria without matching any of the exclusion criteria, patients will undergo tumor resection and less than 25% of residual tumor size, followed by being subjected to histological analysis. Examinations of molecular diagnostics including IDH-1 for confirmation of IDH-1 wild-type GBM according to the 2016 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, and cut-off criteria for expression levels of PD-1 and CD8 (PD-1/CD8 ratio less than 0.21) will be screened for the eligibility to participate in this study and MGMT status will also be determined.\n\nAfter tumor resection, all eligible patients will receive standard radiotherapy (RT) plus Temozolomide (Temodal, TMZ), followed by adjuvant treatment of TMZ. Patients assigned to the investigational group will receive ADCV01 administration as an add-on treatment after operation in this study.\n\nThis study aims to treat eligible patients with ADCV01 as an add-on immunotherapy along with post-surgery GBM treatment and compare the treatment to the conventional therapy (RT plus standard TMZ chemotherapy) alone on the basis of PFS in an unbalanced allocation (investigational group : control group = 2:1). After tumor resection, patients assigned to the control group will receive RT plus TMZ, followed by the scheduled evaluation visits. For patients assigned to the investigational drug group, a standard of 10 doses of ADCV01 (2\u00b10.5 \u00d7 10\\^7 cell/dose) in addition to conventional therapy will be administered.\n\nThe assessment of tumor response is based on \\[Update Response Assessment Criteria for High-Grade Gliomas, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)\\] assessed by the on-site investigator and Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) independently. If needed, the repeat operation for decompressive craniotomy evaluated by the on-site neurosurgeon for relief of increased intracerebral pressure (IICP), or for lifesaving will be allowed in both groups. However, in this study, the reoperation for recurrent tumor will be allowed.\n\nRT will be given if feasible considering the total RT accumulatively given is not enough when tumor recurs (total dose 60 Gy). Gamma knife will not be used for recurrent tumor in this study which is different application from previous research.\n\nRegardless of receiving re-operation or not in both groups, TMZ treatment will be shifted to anti-angiogenic therapy (AVASTIN\u00ae) 10 mg/kg/2weeks for 6 doses after patients have recurrence of GBM. Pseudo-progression may lead to either premature termination of therapy or unnecessary debulking surgeries. Therefore, adjuvant TMZ is recommended to be continued for a minimum of 3 cycles (along with ADCV01 treatment in the first 3 months of the adjuvant TMZ period), after which other imaging techniques (e.g., Gdenhancing MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) should be used to ascertain progression. TMZ is not continuously used whenever recurrence. On this end, the treatment course is complete.\n\nIf the recurrent GBM in patients assigned to the investigational group is occurred before completing 10 doses of ADCV01 treatments, the patient will be treated by the remaining ADCV01 and complete the originally scheduled treatment.\n\nIn this phase II study, 24 eligible primary GBM patients who are with low PD-1/CD8 ratio will be recruited. There will be 16 patients with combination of ADCV01 and conventional therapy, and 8 patients with conventional therapy only. In this trial, the treatment efficacy of ADCV01 measured by one-year PFS rate will be evaluated at the end of phase II study. Because PFS was surrogate endpoint of overall survival in GBM by literature-based meta-analysis from 91 clinical trials, the 1-year PFS rate will be the primary endpoint of GBM clinical trial.\n\nThis study is designed with open-label and randomized parallel group. To date, 34 clinical trials of DC for GBM published up to 2017 in ClinicalTrials.gov, there are 5/34 trials designed by double blinded method and 2/34 trials by single blinded and most of 27/34 trials by open-label (please see ref. ClinicalTrials.gov). The other reason for open-label is that the apheresis for control patients is an invasive procedure. GBM is a not easily curable disease; patients with MGMT methylation have a better survival than with unmethylation. In this trial, MGMT status will be evaluated in all tumor specimens for further subgroup analysis.",

GBM is known to express increased levels of certain antigens that can be targeted by T cells including chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells.\n\nOne promising target in this effort is DLL3, a protein highly expressed on the surface of certain tumor cells including GBM/DIPG/DMG and other central nervous system malignancies but with minimal presence in normal tissues. This expression pattern makes DLL3 an attractive target for precision CAR-T therapy treating brain tumors, which involves engineering a patient's own T cells to recognize and eliminate cancer cells expressing this specific marker.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of DLL3-directed CAR-T cells in patients with recurrent or refractory brain tumors.

    "detailed_description": "Laparoscopically harvested omental grafts are commonly used to fill surgical cavities after resection of head and neck cancers. Investigators hypothesize that an omental tissue graft implanted into our patients with resected recurrent GBM may be used as a readily available and accessible means of circumventing the blood brain barrier (BBB) selectively and focally. The laparoscopically harvested omental graft omentum would easily conform to many resected GBM cavities in our human patients with acceptable risk. The predictable and rich vascular anatomy of a laparoscopically harvested piece of omentum makes it an ideal tissue for cases of previously irradiated and/or infected wound beds. This is why it is successfully used in head and neck and skull base tumors. The permeability of the new blood vessels formed between the omental graft and the cortical brain surface should allow for improved delivery of chemotherapeutics and immune cells (macrophages and T cells) into the vicinity, extracellular space and microenvironment of the resected tumor cavity including the brain adjacent to the tumor (BAT). Milky spots within the greater omentum are very small white-coloured areas of lymphoid tissue will also provide direct deposition of immune cells such as dendritic, macrophages and lymphocytes into the milieu of the resected GBM. The milky spots are made up of mesenchymal cells and are covered in a layer of mesothelium. These structures surround the small blood vessels. The enclosing mesothelium contains macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells. They are also known as secondary lymphoid organs. Most milky spots contain extremely thin-walled lymphatic capillaries. In addition, the technique of fat grafting has been reliably used since 1990 as a way to improve and enhance wound healing, scar healing, as well as tissue augmentation and tissue repair following radiation injury.\n\nAll subjects included in the study will undergo standard surgical resection for diagnosed recurrent GBM. Following the resection, the surgical cavity will be lined with a laparoscopically harvested piece of autologous omentum. The patient's dura, bone and scalp will be closed as is customary. The subject will be followed for side effects within 72 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days and 180 days. Risk assessment will include seizure, stroke, infection, tumor progression, and death.\n\nThe investigators aim to prove that this commonly surgical technique for head and neck cancers and reconstructive surgery is safe in a small human cohort of patients with resected recurrent GBM and may improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).",

    "brief_summary": "Rationale of the Study: Treatment for GBM currently consists of surgical resection of the tumour mass followed by radio- and chemotherapy ((1)Stupp et al., 2005). Nonetheless overall prognosis still remains bleak, recurrence is universal, and recurrent GBM patients clearly need innovative therapies. Dendritic cells (DC) immunotherapy could represent a well-tolerated, long-term tumour-specific treatment to kill all (residual) tumour cells which infiltrate in the adjacent areas of the brain. Preclinical investigations for the development of therapeutic vaccines against high grade gliomas, based on the use of DC loaded with a mixture of glioma-derived tumor have been carried out in rat as well as in mouse models, showing the capacity to generate a glioma-specific immune response. Mature DC loaded with autologous tumor lysate have been used also for the treatment of patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors; no major adverse events have been registered. Results about the use of immunotherapy for GBM patients are encouraging, but further studies are necessary to find out the most effective and safe combination of immunotherapy with radio- and chemotherapy after exeresis of the tumour mass.\n\nAim of the study. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate treatment tolerability and to get preliminary information about efficacy. Secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment effect on the immune response. Additional objective is to identify a possible correlation between methylation status of MGMT promoter and tumor response to treatment.\n\nA two-stage Simon design ((2)Simon, 1989) will be considered for the study. Assuming as outcome measure the percentage of PFS12 patients and of clinical interest an increase to 42% (P1) of the historical control rate of 27% (P0) ((1)Stupp et al., 2005), the alternative hypothesis will be rejected at the end of the first stage if the PFS12 rate will be less than 8/24 treated patients (Fisher's exact test). In the second stage patients will be enrolled up to 76 overall. The null hypothesis will be rejected (a=0.05, b=0.2) if at least 27 subjects out of 76 are alive and progression free 12 months after the beginning of the treatment.",
    "detailed_description": "Background and significance. The therapeutic program will include radical surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy (fractionated local field irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week, Monday through Friday for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) plus temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy). After a 4-week break, up to 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will be administered according to the standard 5-day (oral intake) schedule every 28 days. TMZ dose will be 150 mg per square meter for the first cycle and will be increased to 200 mg per square meter beginning with the second cycle, so long as there is no hematologic toxic effect. Immunotherapy will follow radiochemotherapy and will comprise 4 vaccinations every second week (injections I, II, III, IV), 2 further monthly vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination (injection VII) 2 months after the sixth one. Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while the others will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection (week 13), mTMZ will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status, further vaccine boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination cycle.",

Persistency of the NK cells in the tissue will be assessed by flow cytometry. Tissue cells will be stained with anti human CD45, anti human CD56 and anti HLA molecule expressed by the cord blood donor infused in the patient. NK cells from the tissue may be isolated using magnetic bead selection (anti-HLA specific from cord blood donor labeled with PE and them use a anti PE magnetics bead selection). Those NK cells would be used to perform a chromium release assay (killing assay) to test the ability of the NK in killing K562 and GSC targets. If the NK cells obtained from the tissue are too low to do killing assay, the NK cells could be expanded for one week using UAPC and IL2 to get more NK cells for assays.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n-To determine response as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO), duration of clinical response, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS)\u0192n\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\n-Monitoring immune responses following CB-NK-TGF-\u00a3\\]R2-/NR3C1- dosing, in vivo persistence and expansion of CB-NK-TGF-\u00a3\\]R2-/NR3C1- during treatment, characterization of immune cell subpopulations in the peripheral blood, serum analysis of immune correlates, alloreactivity characterization, and anti-HLA antibody analysis, and CB-NK-TGF-\u00a3\\]R2-/NR3C1- trafficking in tumor microenvironments in the surgical expansion cohort.

    "brief_summary": "In this study, the invesigators look at how a new MRI technique (called amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)) can improve treatment for brain tumors through early detection of tumor progression after radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy treatment.\n\nAn issue with the current treatment for patients with a brain tumor, is the inability to detect tumor progression early. An abnormality is seen on MRI scans taken shortly after treatment with radiotherapy in about 30% of patients.\n\nThis abnormality may be a sign that radiotherapy treatment has worked well and will disappear on its own after a while. However, an abnormality can also be a sign of active tumor tissue. Then it shows that the treatment has not worked well enough. When there is active tumor tissue, this is called 'tumor progression'. When there is an abnormality that disappears on its own after a while, there is no active tumor tissue. This is called 'pseudoprogression'.\n\nCurrently, there are two options to determine whether tumor progression or pseudoprogression has taken place: Do another brain surgery to see if the abnormality contains active tumor tissue or wait and have regular MRI scans until it is clear whether the abnormality goes away on its own.\n\nAmide proton transfer weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (APTw-CEST) imaging is a new MRI technique in which investigators can produce images that show the accumulation of protein. APTw-CEST has previously been shown to be able to distinguish tumor progression from pseudoprogression earlier than current standard MRI scans. However, these previous studies have drawbacks: they were either done with a small group of patients in 1 hospital, or with a 7 Tesla MRI scanner, a rare type of scanner not standard in hospitals, or done in animal models.\n\nIn this research project the investigators now want to prepare APTw-CEST for standard patient care for patients with glioblastoma in the Netherlands so that in the future APTw-CEST can be included as a standard scan during treatment. The investigators are doing this by introducing APTw-CEST MRI on the clinical MRI scanners of four different hospitals. Ultimately, the investigators want to use this to create national guidelines for measuring and viewing APTw-CEST MRI images for early detection of tumor progression.",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale:\n\nA major issue with glioblastoma treatment is the occurrence of contrast enhancement after treatment with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. This enhancement can be due to more tumor growth; called true progression. It can also be due to treatment-related effects; called pseudoprogression. Amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that indirectly images proteins and peptides in a tissue. Because these molecules are overexpressed in tumor tissue, APTw-CEST MRI has been shown to be good at distinguishing between true progression and pseudoprogression, which is important as they require vastly different responses. This technique shows promise to become an important biomarker in glioblastoma treatment, how-ever it currently lacks standardization, as studies are generally done in one center on MRI machines of one vendor.\n\nThis multi-center study will make APTw-CEST MRI a clinically usable biomarker for the detection of tumor progression in glioblastoma patients by providing acquisition and post-processing recommendations, as well as a threshold on APTw-CEST images that would allow a clinician to accurately distinguish between pseudoprogression and true progression, regard-less of where the images were acquired and with which system.\n\nThe underlying processes that make APTw-CEST a reliable biomarker for glioblastoma treatment response evaluation are not clearly known. Using other advanced MRI techniques (diffusion, perfusion) and O-(2-\\[18F\\]fluoroethyl-)-L-tyrosine Positron Emission Tomography (FET-PET), and correlating these images with the APTw-CEST images will give a better insight into these processes.\n\nPrimary Objective: Determine the optimal threshold on APTw-CEST images in a multi-center (4 academic institutes) multi-vendor (Philips, Siemens and GE) clinical trial, to distinguish tumor progression from treatment-related effects.\n\nSecondary Objective(s):\n\n* Correlate APTw-CEST MRI to complimentary, advanced imaging parameters such as FET-PET, diffusion and perfusion MRI, and Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria.\n* Provide recommendations for the acquisition and post-processing of APTw-CEST MRI.\n\nStudy design:\n\nIn this prospective cohort study, all clinical MRI scans will be extended with the APTw-CEST protocol. The patient receives their standard care and decisions will be made based on standard-of-care imaging. The APTw-CEST images and diagnosis from standard follow-up will be used to determine the threshold on APTw-CEST images that would most accurately distinguish between pseudoprogression and true progression early after treatment.\n\nAdditional advanced imaging (diffusion, perfusion, FET-PET) taken during the treatment and follow-up of the patient will be used to correlate areas of high APTw signal with other signals.\n\nStudy population: 120 patients diagnosed with or suspected of glioblastoma using molecular or histochemistry analysis or medical imaging respectively.\n\nIntervention (if applicable): Each patient will have extensions to all MRI scans taken for the treatment and follow-up of glioblastoma. The APTw-CEST sequence will be added to all clinical scans, for an addition of 10-15 minutes of scan time.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Threshold on APTw-CEST images that accurately distinguishes between true progression and pseudoprogression in recently treated glioblastoma patients. The accuracy will be optimized using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the Youden index.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The clinical care of the patient group will not be altered. The APTw-CEST images will not be used to make any clinical decision. Patients will not have personal benefit from this study, and will have the burden of a prolonged scan time of 10-15 minutes. All further imaging used in this study; perfusion, diffusion and FET-PET will not be taken specifically for this study and will only be taken when clinically indicated, except in LUMC where the FET-PET will be added to standard-of-care. The addition of FET-PET in the patient group in LUMC is warranted as the long-term risks are negligible for this patient group, due to the median survival of 12-14 months.",

The standard treatment for GBM, which includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide (known as the Stupp regimen), has remained largely unchanged for over two decades. Patients with GBM who have tumor invasion of the brain ventricles or meningeal metastasis face an even worse prognosis, with significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients without these complications. The blood-brain barrier poses a significant challenge to effective chemotherapy delivery, limiting the efficacy of systemic treatments for central nervous system tumors.

If two or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 106 pfu dose level, then a new cohort will be enrolled at 1 x 105 pfu, using the same approach. If two or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 105 pfu dose level, then the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be consulted to determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of dose de-escalation to 1 x 104 pfu be considered. The highest safe dose will be considered the starting dose for\n\nPhase I/Cohort II. Details of initial dose administration of M032. Patients must be candidates for a resection of the enhancing portion of the recurrent tumor; they will undergo craniotomy, with additional burr holes as needed, and then stereotactic placement of up to 4 infusion catheters. Planned catheter tip locations will include: a) \\> 2.5 cm from a cortical surface; b) \\> 1 cm from an ependymal surface or the margin of the planned resection cavity; and c) if possible, \\> 0.5 cm from a sulcus. This will minimize loss of dose into the subarachnoid or intra-ventricular space during subsequent M032 inoculations.\n\nOnly after catheters have been successfully placed (with Rickham reservoirs used to cap off catheters and hold them in place for the remainder of surgery) will patients will then undergo resection of the enhancing portion of the tumor. Subsequent to the resection but prior to dural closure, M032 will be administered if no ventricular entry has occurred during the resection. M032 will be administered by by multiple free hand injections into the resected tumor bed, using approximately equal volumes at each site (6 ml total). Each inoculation will be administered \\~1 cm apart and delivered into the resected tumor bed over 1 minute and at a 1 cm depth (28G, 1/2-inch needle fitted to a 1-cc tuberculin syringe), where possible. Injections will be placed with careful avoidance of penetration of the ventricular system or any significant vascular structures, and any of the already-placed catheters. Intraoperative ultrasound will be used as needed to define positions of structures or catheters to avoid. After each inoculation the needle will be left in place for up to two minutes before removal and, after removal, the entry site will be covered with hemostatic agent. Both of these measures should minimize reflux of inoculum back into the tumor cavity. Before closing the dura, a fifth catheter will be left in place and then anchored with a Rickham in the tumor resection cavity to allow later access for CSF collection. This Rickham will not be used for M032 administration. The surgical procedure will then be completed in standard fashion. If ventricular entry has occurred during surgery, no M032 will be administered intraoperatively. Instead, a post-operative CT scan will be obtained on Day 1, and the initial M032 dose will be administered as outlined below, using all catheters felt to be appropriately positioned adjacent to the tumor cavity without violating the constraints of the exclusion criteria.\n\nPembrolizumab treatment and subsequent treatments of M032. Starting at week four, patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1). A total of 3 combined doses of Pembrolizumab and M032 will be given. Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 as follows: each total dose (1 x 105 pfu for dose level one, 1 x 106 pfu for dose level two) directly into the remaining tumor bed at the time of craniotomy and immediately after resection for a particular dose level will be divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over two minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the overlying scalp), followed by 0.5 ml of preservative free saline.\n\nDetermination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation. Catheters whose reservoir(s) are closely associated with overlying scalp infections/inflammation will not be injected. Each catheter will be gently aspirated after the Rickham has been accessed but prior to M032 inoculation; catheters from which CSF can be aspirated will not be inoculated to avoid inoculation into the CSF space. The MRI obtained immediately prior to assessment (see schedule, below) will be used to help inform the decision-making above. If there is any question regarding reservoir/catheter suitability, an additional CT or MRI may be obtained prior to inoculation at the PI's discretion.\n\nCombined Pembrolizumab and M032 treatments at each dose level will be repeated at three-week intervals for up to three cycles total, or until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression occurs. Patients who are responding to treatment may be considered for additional dosing after the trial period has been completed.\n\nThe first two patients treated will not require any waiting period between enrollments. If one of the two should develop a toxicity, the third and subsequent (up to six) patients at that level will not be enrolled until seven weeks from the initial dose of M032 and three weeks from the first combined dose of Pembrolizumab and M032 has transpired for the initial two patients and every patient thereafter, to allow adequate duration of time for development of potential dose limiting toxicities in each treated patient before treating the next patient at that level.\n\nPatients will undergo and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab; i If one toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to 6 patients. If 2 or more toxicities occur at the tested dose level, then with the approval of the DSMB, the dose will be de-escalated by one log and a new cohort enrolled with similar rules at the level. If 2 or more toxicities occur at the de-escalated dose level, then the DSMB will be consulted to determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of further dose de-escalation should be considered. The investigators anticipate as few as four patients (given two or more DLTs initially) and as many as 12 (only one DLT at each dose level). However, based on experience with M032 and Pembrolizumab, the investigators expect that this combination will not pro-duce any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).\n\nPhase I/Cohort II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with Pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent Malignant Glioma (MG), the trial will immediately transition into a Phase I Cohort II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. As in Phase I Cohort I, for the Phase I/Cohort II, consented subjects will have safe gross total resection, implantation of up to four Rickham catheters in the peritumoral brain and M032 injected into the wall of the resection cavity as described above.\n\nPatients will be treated with a total dose of of M032 initially at the time of craniotomy as determined in Cohort I, above. They will then undergo treatment with standard fractionated radiation, and temozolomide as determined by treating physician. Starting at week four, patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1) and intratumoral M032 (via the Rickham-catheters placed at the periphery of the tumor cavity-the catheter left in the tumor cavity itself will not be used for M032 inoculation, but only to access CSF). Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 for that dose level divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over 2 minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the over-lying scalp).\n\nDetermination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation. Catheters whose reservoir(s) are closely associated with overlying scalp infections/inflammation will not be injected. Each catheter will be gently aspirated after the Rickham has been accessed but prior to M032 inoculation; catheters from which CSF can be aspirated will not be inoculated to avoid inoculation into the CSF space. The MRI obtained immediately prior to assessment (see schedule, below) will be used to help inform the decision-making above. If there is any question regarding reservoir/catheter suitability, an additional CT or MRI may be obtained prior to inoculation at the PI's discretion.\n\nCombined Pembrolizumab and M032 treatments at each dose level will be repeated at three-week intervals for up to three cycles total, or until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression occurs. Patients who are responding to treatment may be considered for additional dosing after the trial period has been completed.\n\nThe first two patients treated will not require any waiting period between enrollments.

However, based on experience with M032 and Pembrolizumab, the investigators expect that this combination will not produce any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).\n\nPhase II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with Pembrolizumab in patients with newly-diagnosed MG, the trial will immediately transition into a Phase II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. Unlike the Phase I, patients will be eligible to receive Pembrolizumab and M032 every 3 weeks for up to one year. The Phase II design will employ the Simon two-stage optimal study design. It will be a single-arm open-label study of M032+ pembrolizumab and the primary endpoints of Over-all Survival at 12 months and 24 months, and Progression Free Survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6). In the first stage, 6 patients will be accrued. Data will be allowed to mature, and an interim analysis per-formed at that time. During this period, additional subjects may be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in the initial 6 patients, further accrual to the study may be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 16. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more responses are observed in 16 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80% when the PFS-6 is 75%. To allow for 25% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 22 subjects will be enrolled.",

According to the changes in overall survival time after postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy with different radiation doses, the stratification factors included the extent of surgical resection (total resection vs subtotal resection); The time of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (less than 28 days or more than 28 days); MGMT promoter methylation expression (positive or negative).\n\nThe study design was as follows: Participants were required to undergo a screening period within 14 days before randomization to determine eligibility. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups at a 1:1 ratio: trial group, hypofractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by at least 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide; The control group was treated with the existing standardized treatment (standard dose of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and at least 6 cycles of temozolomide adjuvant chemotherapy).\n\nExperimental group: subjects randomly assigned to the experimental group were required to start treatment within 7 working days. The experimental group received hypofractionated radiotherapy with a total dose of 52.5Gy, 3.5 Gy/ fraction, 15 fractions, 5 fractions per week, and temozolomide was given for 21 days. Sequential temozolomide chemotherapy was started 4 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy. Sequential chemotherapy was given 5 days before each 28-day cycle. During the study period, the experimental group was required to complete the vital signs, physical examination, laboratory examination and other examinations within the specified period. After randomization, the experimental group underwent radiologic response assessments (or as deemed necessary by the investigator based on clinical symptoms) and QOLs at the end of radiotherapy, 3-4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, and every 12 weeks (\u00b17 days). Radiologic response assessments required plain and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. If there were residual lesions after surgery, measurable lesions were evaluated according to RANO standard case criteria.\n\nControl group: subjects randomly assigned to the experimental group were treated within 7 working days. The control group received conventional fractionated radiotherapy with a dose of 60Gy, 2Gy per fraction, 30 fractions, 5 fractions per week, and temozolomide was given for a total of 42 days. Sequential temozolomide chemotherapy was started 4 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy. Sequential chemotherapy was given 5 days before each 28-day cycle.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is currently a mainstay treatment for GBM; however, the dose delivered is limited by side effects. The targeted radiotherapy of the TheraSphere GBM Y-90 Glass Microsphere System (TheraSphere GBM) has promising potential to provide GBM patients with reduced side effects compared to external beam radiotherapy as well as a more effective treatment for this catastrophic disease.\n\nThe TheraSphere GBM device utilized in the FRONTIER trial is an yttrium-90 (Y-90) glass microsphere therapy for selective internal radiation therapy (endovascular radiotherapy) in recurrent GBM patients. The TheraSphere GBM treatment utilizes intra-arterial delivery and takes advantage of blood flow and direct tumor delivery. Treatment can be delivered by specific placement of a catheter close to the tumor through known angiographic techniques currently utilized by neuro-endovascular or interventional radiology physicians. Angiographic evaluation prior to treatment allows identification of tumor feeding arteries and definition of the treatment volume. TheraSphere GBM could achieve a high tumor response rate based on delivery of a tumor absorbed dose that is not currently possible with EBRT.\n\nIn consideration of the potential benefit of a more localized, targeted treatment with a reduced side effect profile compared to other treatment options, and the potential impact on patients' quality of life for this devastating disease, this First-in-Human Early Feasibility Study (EFS) of the TheraSphere GBM Y-90 Glass Microsphere System for the treatment of recurrent GBM is being conducted.",

Lifileucel (Amtagvi), the first FDA-approved TIL therapy, has shown remarkable efficacy in treating unresectable or metastatic melanoma. By extracting lymphocytes from the patient's tumor, expanding them ex vivo, and reinfusing them, Lifileucel has significantly improved the immune system's ability to combat cancer cells. This promising approach forms the basis for this study, which aims to apply similar methodologies to advanced or metastatic refractory lung cancer, a condition that generally has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.\n\nThis trial involves several steps: initially, tumor samples are collected from patients for TIL extraction. Afterward, a lymphodepletion regimen using cyclophosphamide and fludarabine is administered to prepare the body for the infusion of expanded autologous TILs. Following the TIL infusion, Aldesleukin (IL-2) is administered to stimulate the TILs' activity. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), an immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 receptor on T cells, is also given to further enhance the immune response against the tumor.\n\nThe primary goal of this trial is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) of this combined therapy. Secondary endpoints include the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and changes in the quality of life (QoL) of patients.\n\nPatients will be closely monitored for side effects and reactions during their hospital stay and throughout the follow-up period. Safety will be assessed based on the incidence and severity of adverse events, while efficacy will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1 criteria. By leveraging the patient's own immune cells and combining them with advanced immunotherapies, this trial aims to provide a novel, personalized treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic refractory lung cancer, building on the success observed with Lifileucel (Amtagvi) in melanoma treatment.",

As a part of this study, participants will either receive Optune with \"standard array mapping\" (based on regular contrast enhanced MRI) or an \"alternative (more precise) array mapping\" based on sophisticated state of the art MRI techniques including \"whole brain spectroscopy\". Whole brain MRI spectroscopy provides additional metabolic information to map out the full extent of tumor spreading within the brain (far beyond from what is seen on regular MRI), by identifying certain metabolites that are present in cancer cells versus healthy tissue. This study is being performed to show whether alternative array mapping improves treatment outcomes, as opposed to the standard array mapping, by maximizing delivery of TTFields dose, thereby achieving more effective tumor cell killing, decreasing the rate of local recurrence, and improving the overall survival as well as quality of life measures.",

One alternative approach, however, is to introduce a tumor-directed therapy such as a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with these immune modulating agents (i.e. immune checkpoint blocking antibodies) to maximize the tumor-specific response but minimize the toxicity associated with increasing non-specific systemic immune activation by generating a potent and focused neoantigen specific immune response.\n\nThis study will test the hypothesis that a personalized neoantigen DNA vaccine in combination with concurrent administration of immune checkpoint blockade therapy will enhance the magnitude and breadth of neoantigen-specific T cell responses while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. The overall goal of this study is to identify the optimal vaccine plus adjuvant platform that can be tested in a subsequent phase II study to determine the efficacy of a personalized neoantigen vaccine approach in patients with GBM.",

During the screening period (Days -28 to -15), subjects will undergo relevant examinations or observations to confirm the disease status, treatment history, and other related information. Subjects who meet the screening criteria will be enrolled in the clinical trial to receive EPC-003 treatment.

All CAR-T cell infusions will be delivered via intraventricular injection.\n\nThis trial comprises two phases: the first phase is the dose-escalation phase, and the second phase is the dose-expansion phase.",
    "detailed_description": "This study is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial investigating the safety and efficacy of B7H3/IL13Ra2 bispecific CAR-T cell preparation in patients with recurrent or refractory glioma.\n\n1.

The accelerated titration design will be applied to the first 3 dose levels (with only 1 subject enrolled per level):\n\n   If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or two grade \u22652 drug-related adverse events (AEs) are observed at any accelerated titration dose level, the current dose level will be expanded to 3 subjects, and subsequent trials will automatically switch to the 3+3 design.\n\n   When 2 out of 3 subjects in a dose group experience DLT, dose escalation will be terminated, and this dose level will be identified as the non-tolerated dose. The previous dose level will then be expanded to 3 subjects.\n\n   During the dose-escalation process, cell infusion for the first subject in the subsequent dose group can only be performed after the last subject in the previous dose group completes the 28-day DLT observation period. Within the same dose group, cell infusion for the second subject may start after the first subject completes the 2-week preliminary safety observation. The third subject will initiate cell infusion after the second subject finishes the 2-week safety observation.\n2. Dose-expansion phase The dose-expansion phase will commence enrollment after preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy results are obtained from the dose-escalation phase. Six patients will be enrolled at the highest tolerable dose level below the non-tolerated dose to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).\n\nMTD is defined as the highest tolerable dose with DLT observed in \u22641/6 subjects. RP2D will be determined based on the review of safety and efficacy data collected from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts.\n\nDuring the trial, if necessary and with consensus, the CAR-T cell infusion schedule may be adjusted from once weekly to once every two weeks, or the dose and dose levels may be reduced.",

    "brief_summary": "This is a pilot or feasibility study to test the study plan and to find out whether enough participants will join a larger study and accept the study procedures. Eligible participants (adults with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme \\[GBM\\] and had a good tumour resection \\[\\>= 70% of initial tumour volume\\] and plan to receive 6 weeks of chemoradiation followed by up to 6 months of chemotherapy) are asked to donate their own stool samples at 4 different time points during their treatment course. Participants will also complete a 7-day diet diary and two questionnaires about their health-related quality of life.\n\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer in adults. The current best evidence-proven treatment for GBM includes maximum safe tumour resection, brain radiation over a 6-week period given with chemotherapy pills called temozolomide (Brand name: Temodal or Temodar), followed by approximately 6 months / cycles of temozolomide. Despite these treatments, the average life expectancy is generally less than 2 years.\n\nResearchers are recognizing that the immune system has an important role in directing the effectiveness of chemotherapy, radiation, and newer therapies such as immunotherapies. Some immunotherapies have been quite successful in improving cancer control and survival in other cancers like melanoma (an aggressive skin cancer), but when these drugs were given to patients with GBM, there appeared to only be a small effect. Therefore, finding ways to make existing and new treatments work better should be a priority. Recent scientific studies have shown that the bacteria that make up our stool, often referred to as the gut microbiome, play a major role in regulating the immune system. For example, researchers were able to make patients with melanoma who previously did not respond to immunotherapy become responsive to the treatment after receiving a stool transplant from responders to immunotherapy. This provides proof of concept that we could modify the body's immune environment to favour cancer killing by changing a person's gut bacteria environment.\n\nThe role of the gut bacteria in patients with brain cancer is poorly understood as very few studies have been published about it in this population. We believe that understanding the composition of the gut microbiome and how it relates to the effectiveness and side effects of treatments in GBM patients will be an important first step to understanding how we can modify the gut microbiome to improve outcomes for patients living with GBM.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a prospective observational study designed to assess changes in the gut microbial composition and diversity in prospectively collected stool samples at important time points throughout GBM treatment and surveillance and to correlate that with patient survival outcomes and radiation necrosis.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. To assess feasibility of stool sample collection, banking, and analysis throughout the treatment course of GBM patients.\n2. To determine the association of gut microbiome composition with survival outcomes in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) type 1 wild type glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)\n3. To assess the association of gut microbiome composition with radiation necrosis\n\nHypothesis: We hypothesize that stool collection and microbiome analysis taken from the time of diagnosis to disease recurrence will be feasible in Ottawa. Secondly, we hypothesize that in patients with newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 4, IDH-1 R132H (Arginine to histidine mutation at site 132) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) receiving chemoradiation (Stupp regimen), increased microbial diversity and abundance of microbiota found to be favorable in other cancers will have better survival outcomes compared to decreased gut microbial diversity and relative abundance of microbiota found to be unfavorable in other cancers\n\nStudy sample size: n=20.\n\nThis study aims to enroll a prognostically uniform population presenting with newly diagnosed GBM at a single cancer center. The primary aim of the study is to establish feasibility of conducting such a study in Ottawa.\n\nPrimary Outcome(s) The primary outcome is study feasibility. Feasibility will be determined by the following co-primary endpoints.\n\n1. Stool sample obtained at pre-radiation, post-radiation (pre-adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy), and at time of disease relapse in \u2265 70% of enrolled patients\n2. Complete 15-patient (75% of target sample size) enrollment within 2 years\n3. Stool sample volume and quality sufficient for analysis in \u2265 75% of collected samples\n\nSecondary Outcomes\n\n1. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in pre-defined subgroups with high gut microbial diversity and relative abundance of taxa associated with favorable outcomes in other cancers vs. low diversity and unfavorable taxa subgroup.\n2. Gut microbial taxonomy and diversity (i.e., microbiome make up) in late progressors versus early progressors\n3. Differences in gut microbiome in patients with and without post-radiation necrosis.\n\nTiming of Standard of Care Visits and Study Procedures\n\nParticipants will be followed as part of standard of care, which involves visits at the following time points:\n\n* Baseline: post-surgery but before temozolomide (chemo) plus radiation (pre-chemoRT)\n* 3-month: approximately one month after 6 weeks of chemoradiation (post-chemoRT), but before starting maintenance phase of chemotherapy\n* Months 4 to 9: monthly while on maintenance phase of chemotherapy\n* Every 2-3 months after completing maintenance chemo, usually corresponding to MRI scans\n\nThere are 4-5 time points during which study participants will be asked to participate in study procedures\n\n1. Stool sample collection - 4 time points from the time of enrollment\n\n   * Baseline - pre-chemoRT\n   * 3 month - post-chemoRT\n   * 1 to 3 months after completing maintenance chemotherapy. As a result, this time point may vary (e.g., could be at 9-month mark if they finished 6 cycles of maintenance chemotherapy on schedule, but may be earlier or later, if patients stop maintenance chemo early or treatments repeatedly get delayed).\n   * Disease recurrence (12-week window of confirmed recurrence date)\n2. 7-day diet diary - 4 time points from time of enrollment.\n\n   * Baseline: pre-chemoRT\n   * 3-month: post-chemoRT\n   * 9-month: usually corresponds to after maintenance chemo\n   * 12 month: even further out from completion of chemo\n3.

The study will have three phases, Phase 1, Phase 2a and Phase 2b.\n\nPhase 1 is a standard cohort dose escalation 3+3 design with a modified Fibonacci dose escalation used to determine the maximum tolerated dose to select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NEO212 for Phase 2a and Phase 2b. The initial dose of NEO212 will be 170 mg and the dose will increase in successive cohorts (220, 400, 610, 810, and 1,000 mg) until a MTD is reached and a RP2D is selected. There will be up to 42 patients enrolled in Phase 1. In the event two DLTs are experienced in any cohort, a dose de- escalation cohort will be followed (with half of the dose increase from the previous cohort) to determine the MTD/RP2D.\n\nPhase 2a is a safety run-in study with a standard 3+3 design used to confirm the safety of the MTD/RP2D of NEO212 when given in combination with select SOC regimens (as defined in Appendix 1) for patients with uncontrolled metastases to the brain (see Appendix 2). There will be up to 12 patients enrolled into each combination regimen to confirm safety. One dose below the NEO212 MTD/RP2D Cohort Dose will be administered as a starting dose to establish safety (3+3), before moving to Phase 2b with the MTD/RP2D (3+3). In the event that two DLTs are experienced for patients receiving the MTD/RP2D in combination with SOC, the dose de-escalation cohort will be expanded to determine the MTD for a newly established Phase 2b Treatment Group.\n\nPhase 2b is a dose expansion study to assess efficacy of NEO212 alone, at the MTD/RP2D in patients with Astrocytoma IDH-mutant, Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype as a single Treatment Group.

    "detailed_description": "Rationale\n\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system characterized by an extremely severe prognosis with a median survival of 14-16 months from diagnosis. Patients affected by high-grade gliomas are treated with a combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. To date, the efficacy of the treatment is assessed through MRI which shows evidence of early radiological progression in up to 50% of all patients. Importantly, signs of tumor progression on MRI images may actually represent pseudoprogression in up to 64% of cases meaning that within 6 months from the end of the radiation treatment 20-30% of patients show increased contrast enhancement that resolves on subsequent MRI scans without changes in the treatment. Pseudoprogression is a phenomenon likely related to inflammation and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by radiation and by the concurrent temozolomide treatment. Being a self-resolving consequence of the therapy rather than a sign of tumor growth, mistaking pseudoprogression for real progression leads to premature discontinuation of therapy and inappropriate evaluation of progression free survival and response rate in clinical trials impairing clinical practice.\n\nTherefore, the differentiation of pseudoprogression from true progression is both a challenge in everyday clinical activity and a relevant problem in clinical trials and research.\n\nA major limitation to the development and assessment of efficacy of current and new therapies in the setting of brain tumors, both at preclinical and clinical levels, however, is the lack of reliable trial endpoints.\n\nA combination of advanced imaging methods, MRI and PET, with innovative techniques investigating cancer-specific biology will allow a holistic characterization of the tumor from multiple aspects crucial to enable a personalized diagnostic and therapeutical approach.\n\nObjective\n\nThe main goal of the project is the development and validation of imaging markers, MRI and PET, plasma biomarkers, and/or cell markers that could support clinicians and researchers in differentiating pseudoprogression from true tumor progression in routine clinical activities and clinical trials in patients affected by GBM.\n\nMain trial endpoints\n\nThe primary endpoint of the study is the elaboration of predictive models (evaluation of specificity and sensitivity) using imaging advanced biomarkers, PET and MRI, biological serum markers, and cancer cell derived makers to differentiate tumor pseudoprogression or real progression in patients affected by GBM who underwent therapeutical protocol as per treating physicians' indications (Stupp or hypofractionated RT).\n\nSecondary trial endpoints\n\nWe aim to establish an in vivo murine model of pseudoprogression by orthotopic transplantation of GSCs derived from thirty-five patient subjected to subsequent treatment with irradiation and temozolomide administration.\n\nTrial design\n\nThis is a pilot prospective interventional clinical trial using a novel 18F-GE-180 PET radio-metabolic marker (AxMP) and MRI with advanced sequences with no modification of standard of care treatment and additional diagnostic procedures that do not pose more than minimal additional risk or burden to the subjects compared to normal clinical practice. The trial will enroll 75 patients in 42 months and will be concluded in 60 months.\n\nTrial population\n\nThe trial will prospectively enroll 75 patients affected by isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH)-wild type Glioblastoma, with an age above 18 years old , who will undergo standard of care treatment.\n\nInterventions\n\nBefore surgery and starting the standard treatment with RT and chemotherapy, all subjects will undergo baseline MRI and 18F-GE-180 PET imaging, and blood withdrawal for evaluation of plasma biomarkers of inflammation, circulating microvesicles, and RNA. MRI exams will then be performed as per standard practice of care every 3 months and in case of clinical deterioration suggesting possible disease recurrence/progression. A second PET-scan along with plasma sample collection will be performed only in case of MRI evidence of either suspected tumor progression or pseudoprogression. In case of MRI evidence of an increase in tumor size (either suspected true tumor progression or pseudoprogression), as for standard of care, the Institutional Multidisciplinary Brain Tumor Board (composed of neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists, radiotherapists) will discuss each patient for determining clinical indication and feasibility of second surgery. In those patients in whom second surgery is not indicated, a stereotactic biopsy will be considered if feasible, safe, and clinically useful. If a stereotactic biopsy is not feasible and safe, a 3-month follow-up will be planned before a change in treatment. When available, pathology will be considered as the gold standard for differentiation pseudoprogression from true tumor progression. In all other subjects, follow-up and overall survival data will be evaluated for this differentiation. In all the subjects, overall survival data will be also recorded for statistical analyses.\n\nCancer Stem Cells /CSC) will be collected form 35 patients and Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) from 10 patients for the creation of a vitro and in vivo murine model.\n\nEthical considerations relating to the clinical trial including the expected benefit to the individual subject or group of patients represented by the trial subjects as well as the nature and extent of burden and risks This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline as well as international and national legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAll study participants will receive the standards of care for GBM. The additional diagnostic procedures (PET scan with a novel tracer and high resolution 3 Tesla scanner MRI) do not entail specific risks for the patient. At every time point (at least before surgery, before RT and in case of pseudoprogression) additional blood samples for the determinations of markers of inflammation and the isolation of circulating microvesicles and RNA will be collected from the patients. Glioblastoma stem cells will be isolated from the tumoral mass excised during glioblastoma surgery in 35 patients; hematopoietic stem cells will be obtained from 10 consenting patients at the time of surgery by aspiration of 30-40ml of bone marrow from the iliac crests, as per standard clinical practice. Since the biopsy will be performed under general anesthesia, the patient should not experience discomfort.\n\nThere are no expected benefits for the individual patient, but the study results might provide important advances for the treatment of future patients.",

In this trial we will implant a novel device with 9 ultrasound emitters, allowing temporary and reversible opening of the BBB to maximize brain penetration of drugs that modulate the immune system. The device will be implanted after radiation is completed. Immune modulating drugs will be given every 3 weeks in conjunction with activation of the device to open the BBB.\n\nThe objectives of this trial are to establish whether it is safe and feasible to administer immune modulating drugs in this manner, and identify whether the treatment is effective in treating glioblastoma.",
    "detailed_description": "Eligible patients will undergo implant of the Soncloud-9 device within 1-5 weeks of completion of radiotherapy. About 1-3 weeks after surgery, patients will undergo sonication and intravenous administration of balstilimab, botensilimab and liposomal doxorubicin. Brain MRI will be done to quantify extent of blood brain barrier opening. The dose for balstilimab is 450 mg every 3 weeks. The dose for botensilimab is 1mg/kg every 6 weeks. The dose for liposomal doxorubicin is 30 mg every 3 weeks. Sonication and administration of study agents will continue every 3 weeks (21 days= 1 cycle) for a total of 9 cycles (approx. 6 months). Additional cycles may be considered if deemed beneficial and in the patient's best interest. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA will also be collected before and after each sonication. The first 6 patients will comprise a safety run-in cohort with intensified safety monitoring through the end of the second cycle.",

AZD1390 is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the signals that cause cancer cells to multiply. This helps to stop the spread of cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving AZD1390 with radiation may be safe, tolerable, and/or effective in treating pediatric patients with high grade glioma, diffuse midline glioma or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.",

The obtained final list is sorted by block together with the progressive enrollment number for the patients.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to select the optimal regimen of L19TNF in combination with lomustine, that maximizes effects on clinical parameters and minimizes the probability of moderate to severe adverse events, among six (three L19TNF doses x two lomustine doses) combination schedules for the treatment of patient with progressing or recurrent glioblastoma.\n\nPrimary endpoints include Safety (Incidence of adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), standard laboratory assessments, ECG, ECHO and physical examination according to CTCAE v.5.0) and Efficacy (Survival rate at 12 months).\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to further evaluate safety, efficacy, exposure, dose-response, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information of the combination of L19TNF and lomustine at different dose levels to determine the best dose regimen for further studies.\n\nDuring the conduct of the study the safety information collected will be routinely reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in order to identify possible safety concerns.\n\nIf the probability in a treatment arm that the development of unacceptable toxicity rate exceeds 33 % is equal or higher than 80%, the recruitment to this treatment arm will be interrupted and the DSMB will be informed to assess the events and relationship to the study treatment. The DSMB may then recommend to re-start recruitment again for the treatment arm or permanently suspend it.\n\nIn case of a treatment-related death, recruitment will be suspended for all treatment arms until the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has reviewed the event and recommended to restart",

    "brief_summary": "The body's biological functions follow a circadian rhythm, meaning that individual biological functions in the body change over a 24-hour cycle. There is evidence suggesting that the body and cancer cells may react differently to anti-cancer treatment based on the time of day they are exposed. In fact, researchers have already found that giving anti-cancer treatments at a particular time of the day works better in rectal and ovarian cancer. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapy pill/capsule commonly given to patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma after brain surgery and radiation treatment. However, there is no current standard for what time of day TMZ should be taken for the treatment of glioblastoma.\n\nIn the current study, participants are randomly placed in one of two groups: a morning group and an evening group. Based on this group placement, participants are instructed to either take their TMZ in the morning or in the evening and record the date and time they take their TMZ in a pill diary. Participants will wear a wrist actigraphy device for the first cycle of TMZ. The primary goal of the study is to understand if taking TMZ at a prescribed time of day (morning/evening) is feasible in adults with glioblastoma. This is a pilot trial, and the investigators hypothesize that it will be feasible for glioblastoma patients to take TMZ at the prescribed time of day. The secondary goals of this study are to evaluate participant recruitment, safety, health-related quality of life, biological timing of TMZ delivery, and changes in condition over time. This pilot study will help investigators plan for a larger, pragmatic randomized clinical trial in the future.",
    "detailed_description": "TMZ-CHRONO is a randomized, multi-centre pilot trial evaluating the feasibility of chronotherapy (dose-timing) for temozolomide (TMZ) in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM).\n\nThe body's biological functions follow a circadian rhythm. Chronotherapy is the deliberate timing of medications to enhance therapeutic benefit and/or minimize toxicity, and can be achieved by dose-timing treatments. There is evidence suggesting that cancer cells may react differently to chemotherapy based on the time of day they are exposed. In fact, researchers have already found that giving anti-cancer treatments at a particular time of the day works better in rectal and ovarian cancer. TMZ is a standard of care treatment for GBM, however there is currently no consensus or guideline with respect to the optimal timing of adjuvant TMZ administration. The study team recently conducted systematic review on TMZ chronotherapy in the treatment of glioma. With emerging evidence that TMZ timing may be important, it is paramount to conduct a large pragmatic randomized study to assess this claim in GBM. The current study is a minimal risk pilot trial to inform the development of a larger, pragmatic randomized clinical trial in the future.\n\nProspective participants will be approached by their physician (or a member within the circle of care) during their routine clinic visit to begin the integrated verbal consent model process. The physician will explain that the patient is receiving standard of care treatment, with the only change being the timing of adjuvant TMZ (morning vs evening). The physician will then ask the patient for verbal consent to participate in this research study and document this consent in the patient's electronic medical record. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to one of two study arms (morning administration of TMZ, and evening administration of TMZ) in a 1:1 fashion using a permuted block design through the Ottawa Methods Centre. Randomization will be stratified by cancer centre \\[The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre (TOHCC) and the London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC); Canada\\]. The participants and investigators will not be blinded to treatment arm allocations. The participants will wear a wrist actigraphy device during the first cycle of TMZ.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to understand if taking TMZ at a prescribed time of day (morning/evening) is feasible in adults with GBM. The secondary aims of the study are to evaluate participant recruitment, safety, health-related quality of life, biological timing of TMZ deliver, and changes in condition over time. Data is collected throughout the study at baseline, randomization, pre/post-TMZ cycles, and at 4-, 8-, 12-, 24-, and 48-weeks after baseline. The study team will continue to follow the participant conditions after TMZ completion for up to 5 years.\n\nThis pilot trial is the first and necessary step to assess the feasibility of randomized treatment allocation, rate of pill diary completion, and metrics surrounding participant accrual. This will help determine the number of recruitment sites and expected duration of accrual for a future pragmatic, randomized clinical trial on chronotherapy of TMZ in IDH-wildtype GBM.",

    "brief_summary": "This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients with glioblastoma. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the intervention to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma.\n\nThe purpose of the initial study cohort (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future.\n\nThree additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \\& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1 administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax.\n\nAn additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide.",

These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause glioblastoma to recur.\n\nMethylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair protein which can be increased in some cancers, including glioblastoma. MGMT works to repair the DNA of cancer cells that are damaged by treatment. If a tumor is found to be \"unmethylated\", it means there is more MGMT present in the tumor than one that is \"methylated\".\n\nMethylation of MGMT is believed to make tumor cells more responsive to drugs like temozolomide. Studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.\n\nPatients with glioblastoma usually receive six weeks of radiation with a daily chemotherapy called temozolomide after their surgery, followed by six to twelve months of additional temozolomide. In this study, only participants whose tumors are MGMT-methylated will receive temozolomide; those participants whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will not receive temozolomide, as studies have shown that temozolomide provides a very small improvement in outcome for many patients whose glioblastoma is MGMT-unmethylated.\n\nOn this trial, an initial cohort of participants (Cohort 1) will receive the Personalized NeoAntigen Vaccine (5 priming doses and 2 booster doses over \\~ 20 weeks) after having completed six weeks of standard radiation. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.\n\nThree additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \\& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1).

    "detailed_description": "The surgical resection of brain tumors is an integral component of modern neuro-oncology. . Extent of resection has been found to be associated with increased overall and progression free survival, with the greatest benefit occurring in the setting of a complete or gross total resection. Unfortunately, there are a number of obstacles unique to brain tumors that may limit the extent of resection. A number of advancements in neurosurgical oncology have emerged to improve the extent of tumor resection while decreasing operative morbidity and mortality. Confocal reflectance microscopy is a routine technique used to visualize tissues without fixation or staining used in classical histological techniques. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) is an optical fluorescence imaging modality used for imaging thick in vivo and ex vivo tissues. Clinically available confocal endomicroscopy systems contain lasers with precise excitation wavelengths and dichroic filters for detecting appropriate emission wave lengths. The studies completed to date do not evaluate the ability of confocal microscopy to discriminate between normal and abnormal tissue at the margins during surgical resection. This is the first of such in vivo feasibility studies that aims to demonstrate this claim of the CONVIVO system.\n\nThe images acquired with the CONVIVO system following administration of fluorescein will be compared to conventional histologic specimens from corresponding biopsies. This is a planned single center study. This study is designed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the CONVIVO system compared with gold-standard histopathology in tissue that has already been identified for resection. The device will not be used to inform surgical decision making, nor will tissue that would not otherwise be resected be biopsied for research purposes.\n\nThis study will rely on study investigators, all physicians at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, to identify subjects. Written consent is required for participation in the study.. There are no specific medical risks to patients associated with the use of CONVIVO. It is not anticipated that there are immediate or direct benefits to patients participating in this study. The CONVIVO imaging data acquired during the procedure will be initially stored on the device's hard drive and later securely uploaded to an encrypted Dartmouth-Hitchcock server. Patients will have the ability to maintain their privacy with minimal disruption or contact by the study team. Additionally, the PI or other investigators will have interactions with the patient as part of their routine clinical care. Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) in treating patients with glioblastoma or astrocytoma that has come back (recurrent) who are undergoing brain surgery (craniotomy). Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of primary and malignant tumor of the brain. Currently, the standard of care for this disease includes surgical resection, followed by radiation with chemotherapy and tumor treating fields. Despite this aggressive therapy, the survival after finishing treatment remains low and the disease often reoccurs. Unfortunately, the available therapy options for recurrent glioblastoma are minimal and do not have a great effect on survival. AMSCs are found in body fat and when separated from the fat, are delivered into the surgical cavity at the time of surgery. When in direct contact with tumor cells, AMSCs affect tumor growth, residual tumor cell death, and chemotherapy resistance. The use of AMSCs delivered locally into the surgical cavity of recurrent glioblastoma during a craniotomy could improve the long-term outcomes of these patients by decreasing the progression rate and invasiveness of malignant cells.",

The dose adjusted Stupp regimen group (mStupp) administered PGTV locally to residual or short-term recurrent lesions after surgery 66Gy/30Gy high-dose irradiation, PTV1 60Gy/30F in high-risk areas around the tumor bed, and 54Gy/30F radiotherapy in low-risk areas. Each group will have weekly blood routine, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzyme spectrum, thyroid function, electrocardiogram, and head MR every 4 weeks to evaluate the efficacy and toxic side effects. Follow up observation will be conducted. The study will start on January 1, 2025 and end on December 31, 2027, to explore the efficacy of enhanced adjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma with partial surgical resection or short-term progression.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research trial is to study the use of differing investigational doses and scheduling for Proton Therapy for tumors previously treated with radiation therapy. Generally, when patients are first treated for cancer with radiation therapy, they are treated with traditional photon (or x-ray) radiation therapy, which uses high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. In some cases, the cancer either returns or a new tumor can present in a different part of the body. With the usual radiation treatment, the photon beams travel all the way through the body. As a result, healthy tissues in front of and behind the tumor are exposed to radiation. Physicians who treat these cases where the tumor has returned often use a much lower dose of radiation to prevent patients from experiencing serious and long-term side-effects. This dose is often not strong enough to destroy the cancerous tumor. Alternatively, they may also treat a smaller area than would be indicated for complete tumor eradication, again in an attempt to prevent serious and long-term toxicities, but at the cost of optimally treating the cancer. Proton therapy, however, may offer a chance to safely deliver a more effective dose and volume of radiation as it is more targeted and can spare healthy tissues surrounding the tumor.\n\nThe reason we are conducting this research study is to look at whether Proton therapy can be a better way to treat reoccurring tumors in patients who have previously received radiation therapy to the same area, compared to treatment approaches used to date.",

Some common risks related to D2C7-IT include: effects related to tumor cells dying (tumor necrosis), effects on normal brain tissue, effects related to catheter placement and removal, effects related to fluid infusion into the brain (intracerebral infusion), and reactions to the D2C7-IT being directly infused in your brain. Risks of 2141-V11 being directly infused in your brain and injected in the area around the lymph nodes of the head and neck could include: cytokine release syndrome (release of immune system cells called cytokines that can cause fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, itching, rash, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting), swelling and redness in the neck area, overstimulation of your immune system such that it attacks other tissues in your body, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets in the blood.",

DWI is a non-invasive MRI modality that has demonstrated an ability to predict for a response to radiation therapy in the primary treatment of patients with glioblastoma (GBM). PWI is one collection of measures that includes dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) enhancement and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The latter methods of MRI-adapted radiotherapy allow the opportunity to direct high-dose radiation to areas most likely to harbor resistant tumor while avoiding regions having a low likelihood of future recurrence. Multiple MRI sequences have been developed and validated that may identify high-risk areas in patients with High-grade glioma (HGG) and the ability to acquire multiple sequential time points creates an opportunity for dynamic radiotherapy that has not previously been explored. The current standard of care in radiotherapy does not incorporate any additional neuroimaging data.\n\nThis study hypothesizes that pre- and mid-treatment advanced imaging with (DWI) and (PWI) in patients with HGG can be used to generate an adaptive radiotherapy boost volume that correlates with areas of future recurrence and that this volume has a higher spatial correlation relative to the current standard of care.",

The primary question is whether the patient's response to temozolomide is recapitulated in their corresponding patient-derived glioblastoma organoid (GBO). Patient drug responses are evaluated using survival data, while GBO drug responses are assessed through a drug-response testing platform utilizing cell viability assays. Additionally, this platform is used to explore the potential application of various chemotherapeutic agents.",
    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a highly aggressive brain tumor with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the only approved first-line therapy, but frequent resistance limits its efficacy, highlighting the urgent need for alternative treatments. Patient-derived glioblastoma organoids (GBOs) offer a promising preclinical model for personalized drug testing and therapy development.\n\nIn our previous study, we established 20 GBO lines using a serum-free protocol, preserving the histopathological and genomic features of the parental tumors. Additionally, GBO Drug Sensitivity Testing (GBO-DST) was developed to evaluate TMZ responsiveness and to screen several FDA-approved drugs, including Lazertinib and Regorafenib. The GBO-DST was successfully validated by correlating IC50 values with progression-free survival, GBO size measurement after treatment, and histopathological evaluation.\n\nThe goal of this study is to investigate whether a preclinical model using GBOs can eventually replace clinical trials. Therefore, it is necessary to collect diverse genetic information from patients in a multicenter setting, along with corresponding GBOs that recapitulate the patient tumors. Using GBO-DST, external cohort validation will be performed. Concurrently, the study aims to predict the potency of multi-kinase inhibitors or EGFR-TKIs, which are expected to show efficacy based on prior research, and compare these predictions against clinical outcomes.\n\nThis study aims to establish 100 GBO lines, targeting the enrollment of 150 patients, considering a previous success rate of 66.7% for GBO establishment. Since the study requires tumor tissue and genetic information from patients, IRB approvals from multiple institutions have been secured (including five tertiary hospitals in South Korea: Chungnam National University Hospital, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Keimyung University Hospital, Yeungnam University Hospital, and Dong-A University Hospital). However, as this study retrospectively correlates patient clinical outcomes with GBO-DST results, it does not involve direct interventions with patients. Specifically, GBO-DST results for multiple candidate drugs will not be used to alter patients' treatment regimens.\n\nThe study collects clinical information and genetic data from patients, with clinical outcomes defined as progression-free survival and overall survival. Radiologic data will be prospectively collected to achieve these objectives.\n\nThrough this study, we aim to validate the findings of previous research by confirming that GBO-DST accurately recapitulates patients' drug responses. Furthermore, we seek to establish GBO-DST as a preclinical trial platform capable of replacing traditional clinical trials.",

    "brief_summary": "The objective of the BELGICA trial is to evaluate if radiotherapy could be given in a more focused manner in patients with glioblastoma in order to reduce side effects and improve quality of life.\n\nThe glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive tumour originating from the brain, affecting approximately 600 patients per year in Belgium. The treatment consists in surgical resection of the tumour (when feasible), followed by a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite multimodal treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), the life expectancy of patients with GBM remains limited, with an average survival of 12-18 months and only 5% of patients surviving more than 5 years. In addition to limited survival, most patients with GBM experience impaired quality of life, both because of the disease and treatments.\n\nRadiotherapy is a treatment where radiation is used to kill cancer cells. In GBM, radiotherapy is targeted at the tumour (or tumour bed if the tumour was resected) with a safety margin around it (the \"Clinical Target Volume\" or CTV) to account for potential microscopic spread of the tumour. The downside of this safety margin is that a substantial amount of brain tissue is irradiated, which can lead to treatment toxicity. Reducing the CTV margin would enable to decrease the volume of brain being irradiated and could thereby allow to reduce the side effects of brain irradiation.\n\nThe BELGICA trial (Achieving a BEtter outcome through Limiting the GlIoblastoma Clinical tArget volume) is a national multicentre trial which will evaluate if reducing the irradiation volume in glioblastoma is safe and allows for lowering side effects and improving quality of life.",

    "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and radiation therapy work in treating patients with IDH wildtype historically lower grade gliomas or non-histological molecular glioblastomas. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. The goal of this clinical research study is to compare receiving new radiation therapy doses and volumes to the prior standard treatment for patients with historically grade II or grade III IDH wild-type gliomas, which may now be referred to as IDH wildtype molecular glioblastomas at some institutions. Receiving temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy may also help to control the disease.",

It is based on the results of ongoing studies at our Institute to validate the efficacy of extremely hypofractionated RT in neoadjuvant settings, which observed immunostimulatory effects of RT and the synergy with immune components. The collaboration between San Raffaele Hospital (Milan), the IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori Fondazione G. Pascale (Naples) and the San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital of National Relief and High Specialty (Avellino) will ensure that patient recruitment, treatment and monitoring can be translated into facilities of the National Health System using common procedures. The various departments involved will treat patients with the same methods synergistically exploring the immuno/biological factors related to efficacy (and/or toxicity), based on new radioimmunotherapeutic approaches. Clinical and research activity will be developed jointly, drawing on the expertise in radiotherapy, radiomics, oncology, imaging and immunotherapy skills already available.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a prospective multicenter pilot study. Functional and spectroscopic neuroradiological imaging will be adopted for treatment planning. Specialized software will be used to perform radiomic feature extraction and analysis of pre-trained neural networks from the advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT (computed tomography) used for simulation, to identify distribution patterns of aggressive and radioresistant disease areas, with higher probability of disease recurrence, and to intensify the dose on the areas identified as more aggressive, in order to counteract intrinsic radioresistance. The hypofractionated radiotherapy paradigm claims the benefit of reduced treatment times, improved quality of life, better access to specialized treatment centers and potentially improved tumor outcomes with greater disease control and less tumor repopulation. The rationale for neoadjuvant RT is based on the idea of counteracting the tumor's aggressive mechanisms with radiotherapy before the disease is surgically removed, in order to maximize the immunostimulatory potential of RT, and therefore reduce recurrences. Neoadjuvant treatment offers numerous advantages, first of all the ability to adjust the dose to the pathological volume identified by MRI and limit the volume of irradiated healthy brain tissue. Furthermore, the use of imaging derived from functional neuroradiological and spectroscopic techniques for treatment planning would allow us to increase the dose on the areas identified as more aggressive, in order act against intrinsic radioresistance. One of the major risks could be the possibility of developing radionecrosis, but this would not be a cause for concern in the neoadjuvant setting, as all irradiated tissue will then be surgically removed. Patients who agree to participate in the study and who would be candidates for radical surgical treatment, according to the evaluation of the Neurosurgery Department of our Institute, will be treated. These patients will receive neoadjuvant radiation treatment in 5 fractions delivering 30 Gy on PTV and 35-50 Gy on GTV, with a dose-escalation modality that involves increasing the dose to 35-40-42.5-45-47.5-50 Gy in groups of 5 consecutive patients, using standard chemotherapy (TMZ) after surgery.\n\nCurrent diagnostic brain MRI allows a good definition of the initial disease and its most aggressive areas. Since relapses have always been found to occur in irradiated areas and recent studies have shown that reducing margins does not affect overall survival, smaller margins will be used from GTV to CTV and from CTV to PTV. Therefore, smaller volumes will be generated and treated with hypofractionation. Biological equivalent doses (BED) to the standard prescription will be delivered, with boost to a higher biological equivalent dose, in the most aggressive areas, in order to obtain better local control, maintaining an acceptable level of toxicity and therefore improve the evolution of the disease. CE marked devices (software) will be used according to the approved use, for the definition of the target (CT and MRI) and for the delivery of the treatment (linear accelerators) and the standard drug, which has the authorization for marketing, will be prescribed. Radiomic features related to local response and survival will be identified, to obtain a predictive model. At the same time, we will collect PMBC and patient serum in the biobank to identify presumed immunocorrelated of therapy efficacy and/or predictive biomarkers of response/toxicity to therapy. For comparative purposes, serum from healthy volunteers will also be collected, in numbers equivalent to patients and with sex and age characteristics comparable to the latter.",

    "brief_summary": "This clinical trial studies the effect of cancer directed therapy given at-home versus in the clinic for patients with cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Currently most drug-related cancer care is conducted in infusion centers or specialty hospitals, where patients spend many hours a day isolated from family, friends, and familiar surroundings. This separation adds to the physical, emotional, social, and financial burden for patients and their families. The logistics and costs of navigating cancer treatments have become a principal contributor to patients' reduced quality of life. It is therefore important to reduce the burden of cancer in the lives of patients and their caregivers, and a vital aspect of this involves moving beyond traditional hospital and clinic-based care and evaluate innovative care delivery models with virtual capabilities. Providing cancer treatment at-home, versus in the clinic, may help reduce psychological and financial distress and increase treatment compliance, especially for marginalized patients and communities.",
    "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare mean patient-reported rating of Cancer Connected Access and Remote Expertise (CARE) using a modified question from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Cancer Care Survey after 8 weeks between patients randomized to receive care at home and care in the clinic.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate patient preference for location of cancer treatment administration, at the infusion center or in the home.\n\nII. To evaluate level of comfort with receiving infusions at home based on the following measures after 24 weeks of treatment:\n\nIIa. The proportion of patients who indicate a preference for home infusion or no preference versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment as assessed via the Patient Preference Questionnaire; IIb. The proportion of patients who indicate comfort (quite a bit or very much) with receiving infusions at home as assessed by the Patient Preference Questionnaire.\n\nIII. To describe other patient experience questions within the Patient Preference Questionnaire after 24 weeks of treatment.\n\nIV. To describe whether patients felt that infusions at home was worthwhile, would do it again, and recommend it to others after 24 weeks of treatment using the Was It Worth It questionnaire.\n\nV. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard administration (in clinic) in patient-reported function and global health/quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Function 17-Item (EORTC QLQ-F17) after 8 weeks of home versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment.\n\nVI. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard administration (in clinic) in patient-reported symptoms as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) after 8 weeks of home versus outpatient infusion unit administration of cancer treatment.\n\nVII. To assess the safety of home administered intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SQ) drug treatment when administered at home by a home health provider with remote patient monitoring and Command Center support, based on the incidence, nature, severity, and attribution to the location of cancer care of the following:\n\nVIIa. Grade 3+ adverse event (AE) clinically graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0), particularly those possibly, probably, or definitely related to the location of cancer care (i.e., at home versus in clinic).\n\nVIII. To test whether home-based virtual delivery of cancer directed therapy is superior to standard in clinic administration in the proportion of patients with an emergency room visit or hospitalization at the end of 6 months of study treatment.\n\nIX. Overall survival.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the cost of care in first 6 months (data collected out to 1 year). II. To evaluate administration of treatment based on clinical practice data.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive at least 1 cycle of their standard of care (SOC) treatment regimen in the clinic in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients continue receiving their SOC treatment regimen at home for approximately 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. This includes drug administrations, injections/infusions and routine clinical laboratory tests in the home from the Home Health Nurse Provider (HHNP), overseen by Mayo Clinic's home health program Cancer CARE Beyond Walls (CCBW) Command Center. Patients are also provided biometric devices for health monitoring vital signs, as well as a computer tablet for video visits with the Mayo Clinic care team.\n\nARM B: Patients continue receiving their SOC treatment regimen in the clinic for approximately 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then begin receiving their SOC treatment regimen at home as in Arm I for an approximate additional 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed for 1 year.",

    "brief_summary": "MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes and, consequently, of intracellular signalling pathways that govern cellular behaviour (Komatsu et al., 2023). They are widely implicated in oncogenesis, and in particular in mechanisms promoting cell migration, invasion and proliferation (Romano et al., 2021). Several preliminary studies have shown that serum levels of pro-oncogenic microRNAs correlate with tumor rates in gliomas (Jones et al., 2021; Levallet et al., 2022; Morokoff et al., 2020). Morokoff's study showed encouraging but insufficient results on the possibility of using microRNAs to differentiate radionecrosis versus recurrence. These results need to be consolidated prospectively, with homogeneous samples taken from all patients.\n\nThe aim of this study is to describe the evolution over time of plasma levels of pro-oncogenic microRNAs, after surgery for grade 4 glioma, in order to assess whether they can be used to identify false-positive recurrences on MRI (radionecrosis).",
    "detailed_description": "Diffuse gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system, representing around 3,400 cases per year in France (Defossez et al., 2019). Their grade varies from 2 to 4. Whatever the grade, their prognosis is dismal (Grade 2: median survival \\> 10 years, Grade 3: median survival around 5 years, Grades 4: median survival \\< 2 years) (Yang et al., 2016).\n\nGrade 4 diffuse gliomas are the most common gliomas. Their treatment is based on excision of the tumor as completely as possible while preserving the patient's neurological functions. This surgical treatment is followed by a \"Stupp\" radiochemotherapy protocol (Stupp et al., 2005). Nevertheless, recurrence of grade 4 gliomas after surgery is inevitable, and usually occurs within 2 years of surgery (Pineda et al., 2023). In fact, gliomas are infiltrating tumors, with tumor cells infiltrating the brain parenchyma up to 2 cm from the periphery of the tumor visualized on MRI, which explains their inevitable recurrence, since surgery cannot be wide (it is difficult to achieve \"safety margins\" at the cerebral level) and will invariably leave tumor cells in situ (Pallud et al., 2013).\n\nIn the event of recurrence, second-line chemotherapy or further surgery may then be proposed to the patient. Patients are monitored by regular brain MRI scans, but it is important to be aware of the risks involved.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this 1:1 randomized, multi-center, open-label phase Ib/II clinical trial is to explore the efficacy of the add-on of the anti-glutamatergic drugs gabapentin, sulfasalazine and memantine to standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide compared to chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: Glioblastoma is the most common and the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The clinical course of glioblastoma is invariably fatal despite multimodal therapy comprising surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy. Population-based median overall survival is in the range of only 12 months. Glioblastomas synthesize and secrete large quantities of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, driving epilepsy, neuronal death, tumor growth and invasion.\n\nRationale: Several brain-penetrating drugs that have obtained clinical approval in other contexts can inhibit glutamate synthesis, secretion and signalling, including (i) the anti-epileptic drug gabapentin, which is a potent inhibitor of the critical glutamate synthesis enzyme branched chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT-1), (ii) the anti-inflammatory drug sulfasalazine, which is a potent inhibitor of glutamate secretion by blocking the cystine-glutamate exchanger system Xc, and (iii) the cognitive enhancer memantine, which can prevent glutamate-driven, calcium-induced neuronal death and tumor cell invasion by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors. The omnipresence and pleiotropic functions of glutamate in glioblastoma lends rationale for a combined anti-glutamatergic therapeutic approach. The well-documented tolerability of these drugs support the feasibility of a repurposing approach in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy. There is limited commercial interest in exploring the activity of these drugs as anti-cancer agents.\n\nAim: The aim of the herein proposed clinical trial is to explore the tolerability and efficacy of combined anti-glutamatergic treatment as an add-on to standard chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The trial is designed to explore the efficacy of a triple anti-glutamatergic treatment regimen to justify and statistically plan a subsequent phase III expansion trial.\n\nMethodology: This randomized phase Ib/II, parallel-group, open-label, multicenter trial will be conducted in 120 adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Any study treatments will be administered orally in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy and will be continued until tumor progression. The trial design comprises a per-patient dose-escalation approach in the experimental arm, i.e. doses of the study drugs will be increased weekly to pre-specified maximum dose levels and will be reduced if toxicities attributed to either study drug occur. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and will be analysed by intent-to-treat. After the first 20 events in the experimental study arm, an interim toxicity analysis will be performed to evaluate study discontinuation and maximum target dose level adaptions. Secondary endpoints include estimates of median PFS and overall survival (OS), OS at 12 months, seizure-free survival (SFS) and SFS-6. Secondary objectives include the central review of neuropathological diagnoses, central response assessment on magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRI) utilizing the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group criteria, determination of quality of life of patients and their care givers, symptom burden, cognitive functioning, anti-epileptic drug use, steroid use and exploratory analyses of outcome among molecular glioblastoma subtypes determined by methylome and gene panel sequencing.",

Currently, pre-operative T1 contrast enhanced weighted (T1c) MRI is used to identify the tumor for resection. We recently found the combination of apparent diffusion coefficient MRI and O-(2-\\[ 18F\\]fluoroethyl-)-L-tyrosine positron emission tomography (ADC/FET) to be significantly more accurate than T1c MRI alone in the detection of tumor infiltration. This makes ADC/FET a suitable candidate to guide supramarginal resection. Since FET PET is not as accessible and widely available as MRI, identification of an MRI based alternative could result in a more widespread implementation. Amide proton transfer chemical exchange saturation transfer (APT-CEST) MRI is a novel potential alternative for FET PET, since both measures are related to protein content.\n\nObjective: In this project we aim to develop a safe and effective technique for ADC/FET guided resection of IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and grade IV IDH-mutant astrocytoma. The safety concerns neurological deficits and time to start of adjuvant therapy, while the effectiveness is aimed at the extent of resection. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI and to assess whether APT-CEST MRI can serve as an alternative for FET PET for the detection of tumor infiltration.\n\nStudy design: prospective observational intervention study\n\nStudy population: 30 patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of an untreated high grade glioma (suspected for glioblastoma (IDH wildtype) or grade IV astrocytoma (IDH mutant)), who are eligible for a supramarginal surgical resection and adjuvant treatment according two neurosurgeons in consensus and who are in relatively good condition (Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) \u226570).\n\nIntervention (if applicable): supramarginal ADC/FET-guided resection. To make sure that the standard treatment is always guaranteed, T1c MRI abnormalities will be included in the surgical target.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: the main study endpoint is the optimization of ADC/FET-guided resection. Volumetric and percentual extent of resection, as measured with MRI and PET imaging, combined with surgery-induced morbidity will be used as outcome parameters. The secondary study parameters will be the histopathology-based diagnostic accuracy of APT-CEST MRI in comparison with FET PET, cognitive performance over time and progression free survival.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: participants will undergo pre- and postoperative MRI scanning. This is also part of regular clinical care, except there are additional MRI sequences including APT CEST in the pre-operative and pre-radiotherapy MRI. There are no risks associated with MRI acquisition after MRI safety screening. Participants will furthermore undergo a pre- and postoperative FET PET. The risks associated with PET scanning are limited, and the radiation burden will remain below 10 mSv (ICRP62 category intermediate risk (level IIb)). During surgery, biopsies are performed from areas that will be resected, so these biopsies will not introduce any extra risk. A potential benefit is the possibility of the removal of more tumor tissue. A potential risk is the additional removal of healthy brain tissue with the risk of neurological damage, which is controlled by pre- and intraoperative techniques such as visualization of white matter tracts and mapping (both asleep and awake) of critical functions such as language and control of strength.",

Radiation treatment and patient follow-up will occur according to the clinical standard.",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale: One of the fundamentals of glioblastoma management is radiotherapy, where ionizing radiation is aimed towards a specific target area in the brain to inhibit further tumor growth. As these brain tumors are notorious for their extensive tumor infiltration, where tumor grows beyond the tumor that is visible on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this target area, defined as the clinical target volume (CTV), consists of the visible tumor plus a 1.5-cm isotropic safety margin. In the majority of cases, this unspecific CTV margin adequately covers tumor infiltration, but inevitably also includes considerable amounts of healthy tissue. Radiation-induced side-effects like headaches, nausea, fatigue and cognitive decline can substantially affect the quality of life for these patients. An opportunity arises to indirectly visualize tumor infiltration with state-of-the-art advanced MRI (aMRI) techniques, providing additional information on biology rather than only showing anatomical information through conventional MRI. A workflow has been developed to create a CTV based on these aMRI scans (CTVbio) rather than an isotropic expansion. With the additional information that aMRI provides, it could be possible to more accurately define what needs to be targeted and thus minimize damage to healthy tissue. In this research, the aim is to assess the potential of integrating aMRI into radiotherapy target delineation for patients with a glioblastoma by comparing the pattern of failure (coverage of first tumor recurrence by the radiotherapy plan) and the expected radiation dose to organs at risk between the CTVbio and the 1.5-cm CTV. It is hypothesized that the CTVbio can result in decreased radiation dose to organs at risk, whilst having similar pattern of failure.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\n\u2022 To demonstrate that the probability for reduced coverage of the recurrence volume by a radiotherapy plan based on a CTVbio, compared to the clinical radiotherapy plan (1.5-cm CTV), is lower than 0.20.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* To illustrate a reduction in dose to organs at risk with a radiotherapy plan based on a conceptual CTVbio compared to the clinical radiotherapy plan (1.5-cm CTV).\n* To evaluate the synergistic information that each individual aMRI-scan provides for the identification of tumor infiltration.\n* To explore the association between pathophysiological changes on aMRI and future tumor recurrence.\n\nStudy design: In this prospective cohort study, the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning of glioblastoma patients will be extended with aMRI techniques that assess altered oxygenation, angiogenesis and increased protein concentration. In clinical practice at the Erasmus MC, not all patients get an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy. Patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, will get an extra MRI-scan when they participate in this study. Radiation treatment (and patient follow-up) will occur according to the clinical standard, i.e. using the 1.5-cm CTV for radiotherapy planning. The aMRI-scans will be used to create a theoretical CTVbio and corresponding radiotherapy plan. Pattern-of-failure analysis and assessment of dose to organs at risk will be done to compare the radiotherapy plan based on the 1.5-cm CTV with the (theoretical) radiotherapy plan based on the CTVbio. Additionally, various theoretical CTVs based on different combinations of aMRI-scans are generated to explore the added value of the different aMRI techniques. Lastly, the signal intensities on the aMRI-scans at the site of tumor recurrence are compared with contralateral normal-appearing white matter.\n\nStudy population: Patients (\u2265 18 years), diagnosed with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, as confirmed by molecular or immunohistochemistry analysis post resection/biopsy and referred to outpatient clinic of the Department of Radiotherapy to undergo standard treatment with radiotherapy. The inclusion comes to an end when 53 patients have been included.\n\nIntervention: Patients will have an extension to their standard radiotherapy planning MRI-scan taken for regular clinical care (Brain tumor MRI protocol: \u00b1 25 minutes). Patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, will get an extra MRI-scan when they participate in the study. The duration of the extended MRI-scan, which includes the brain tumor MRI protocol, is \u00b1 45 minutes.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: Pattern of failure and dose to organs at risk by the radiotherapy plan based on the 1.5-cm CTV and the theoretical plan created with the CTVbio.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: For patients who will already undergo an MRI-scan for radiotherapy, the burden will be an extended MRI-scan (+20 minutes; the total scan time will be 45 minutes instead of 25 minutes). There is no benefit for these patients. For patients who would not have received an MRI-scan prior to radiotherapy, the burden of participation will be an extra MRI-scan (total scan time: 45 minutes) with additional contrast injection. The dosage and administration are similar to the standard Brain tumor MRI protocol, which has often already been acquired before in these patients. The radiation oncologist may decide to use the conventional MRI-scan from this study MRI for target delineation if they believe it has an added value. The use of the conventional MRI-scans is recommended in the ESTRO-EANO guidelines, but is not routinely done for all patients at Erasmus MC. The advanced MRI-scans investigated in this research will not be used by the radiation oncologist",

An initial retrospective matched-pair analysis showed that this theoretical physical benefit is also clinically associated with a reduction in toxicity during therapy and in the first few months thereafter. The aim of the GRIPS study is to prospectively test this clinical benefit in a randomized, open-label Phase III study. Patients are treated in the study using either modern photon radiation techniques (standard arm) or proton beams (experimental arm).

    "brief_summary": "The study is designed to use infusion of a non-radioactive, naturally occurring isotope of glucose (13C) in patients undergoing surgical resection for a newly identified brain mass to obtain the metabolic phenotype of the tumor, and correlate it with the histopathological diagnosis. In each patient, 13C NMR spectral analysis of tumor extracts will be obtained after intraoperative infusion of \\[U-13C\\]glucose or \\[1,2-13C\\]glucose. Whenever feasible, patients will undergo 3 preoperative imaging studies - 18FDG-PET, diffusion tensor imaging with 1H-spectroscopy on 3T MR scanner, and ultra high resolution MR imaging on the 7T MR scanner. The results of these imaging studies will be correlated with the metabolic phenotype to generate a comprehensive non-invasive view of the tumor with the goal of identifying infiltrative, metabolically active tumor cells within the brain. In addition, a comprehensive molecular profile of the tumor will be obtained and enable a genotype-metabolic phenotype comparative analysis.\n\nCorrelative Translational Research The investigators will obtain tumor tissue from each patient for comprehensive molecular analysis (array CGH, expression profiling, methylation profiling) which will be correlated with tumor histology, the metabolites identified by 1H-MR spectroscopy and the 13Cglucose metabolic profile. Patients will be followed at designated time points along their treatment course to obtain information about ongoing treatment and response, time to tumor progression and overall survival. These parameters will be used in correlational analysis with the metabolic phenotype.",

Patients with a brain mass identified on brain imaging and who need surgical resection of the mass will be eligible for this metabolism study. Eligible study patients will be screened, recruited, and enrolled at UT Southwestern Medical Center in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital - Zale Lipshy and University Hospital - St. Paul, Children's Medical Center of Dallas as well as at Parkland Health and Hospital System. We will consent 60 patients, including projected screen failures and early withdrawals, and anticipate that we will study 25 patients in this clinical protocol. Once enrolled, patients will undergo a series of preoperative brain imaging studies including 3T MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and 1H-MR spectroscopy, 7T MRI and a brain 18FDG-PET scan within 7-14 days of the scheduled operation. Of these studies, only the 3T MRI is standard of care. The DTI and 1H-MR spectroscopy are additional scanning sequences that are being done for research purposes. Similarly, the 7T MRI and the 18FDG-PET are being done for research purposes only. On the day of surgery, the patient will have a peripheral IV started while waiting in the preoperative holding area and a 20% solution of either \\[U-13C\\]glucose and/or \\[1,2-13C\\]acetate (to be determined for each individual patient by the PI) will be infused at a rate of 4g/hr for a maximum of 4 hours. During the infusion period, 4 timed blood samples will be collected for NMR analysis of 13C-glucose in the blood. The infusion will continue until the tumor has been resected and samples have been collected and flash frozen for 13C-NMR spectral analysis and molecular analyses. The infusion and tumor collection for 13C-NMR analysis is being done for research purposes only. However, the remainder of the neurosurgical operative and post-operative procedures will be followed according to standard practice. The patient will be seen 10-14 days after surgery for a follow up visit at which time an assessment of adverse events will be performed. Thereafter, every 6 months for 5 years or until death, the patient will be contacted and data regarding treatment, responses, and tumor progression will be collected for correlative analysis.",

    "brief_summary": "A greater extent of resection of the contrast-enhancing (CE) tumor part has been associated with improved outcomes in high-grade glioma patients. Recent results suggest that resection of the non-contrast-enhancing (NCE) part might yield even better survival outcomes (supramaximal resection, SMR). Therefore, this study evaluates the efficacy and safety of SMR with and without mapping techniques in HGG patients in terms of survival, functional, neurological, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes. Furthermore, it evaluates which patients benefit the most from SMR, and how they could be identified preoperatively.\n\nThis study is an international, multicenter, prospective, 2-arm cohort study of observational nature. Consecutive HGG patients will be operated with supramaximal resection or maximal resection at a 1:3 ratio. Primary endpoints are: 1) overall survival and 2) proportion of patients with NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) deterioration at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Secondary endpoints are 1) residual CE and NCE tumor volume on postoperative T1-contrast and FLAIR MRI scans 2) progression-free survival; 3) onco-functional outcome, and 4) quality of life at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively.\n\nThe study will be carried out by the centers affiliated with the European and North American Consortium and Registry for Intraoperative Mapping (ENCRAM).",

Eligible patients are operated with supramaximal resection versus maximal resection with a 1:3 ratio with a sequential computer-generated random number as subject ID. Intraoperative mapping techniques and/or surgical adjuncts can be used in both treatment arms to ensure the safety of the resection (to minimize the risk of postoperative deficits). Supramaximal resection is defined as 0 cm3 CE tumor and 5 cm3 or less NCE tumor, whereas maximal resection is defined as 0 cm3 CE tumor and \\>5 cm3 NCE tumor (in line with the updated RANO criteria).\n\nStudy patients are allocated to either the supramaximal or maximal safe resection group and will undergo evaluation at presentation (baseline) and during the follow-up period at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postoperatively. Motor function will be evaluated using the NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) scale. Language function will be evaluated using a standard neurolinguistic test-battery consisting of the Aphasia Bedside Check (ABC), Shortened Token test, Verbal fluency, Picture description and Object naming. Cognitive function will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). Patient functioning with be assessed with the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status classification system. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ BN20 and EQ 5D questionnaires. Overall survival and progression-free survival will be assessed. We expect to complete patient inclusion in 4 years. The estimated duration of the study (including follow-up) will be 5 years.\n\nThe primary study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of supramaximal resection versus safe maximal resection in HGG patients as measured by overall survival (OS) and postoperative NIHSS deterioration. Secondary study objectives are to evaluate extent of resection of CE and NCE tumor, quality of life, progression-free survival (PFS), onco-functional outcome (OFO), and SAEs after SMR or maximal safe resections as measured by volumetric analyses of contrast-enhanced MRI images with gadolinium combined with FLAIR images, tumor progression on MRI scans, quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ BN20, EQ 5D), combining postoperative residual volume with NIHSS outcomes, and recording SAEs respectively.\n\nPatients will be recruited from the neurosurgical or neurological outpatient clinic or through referral from general hospitals of the participating neurosurgical hospitals, located in Europe and the United States.

    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary brain tumor and also has the worst prognosis with a mean survival time below 1 year and a 5-year survival rate of less than 2%. AF is a 41kilodalton endogenous and essential protein with antisecretory and anti-inflammatory effects. Endogenous AF activity increases after exposure to bacterial toxins and endogenous triggers of inflammation. The active amino-terminal portion of AF has been synthesized as a 16 amino acid peptide (AF-16) and has been used in animal experimental studies. Salovum\u00ae is a product based on egg yolk powder B221\u00ae and contains high levels of AF. Salovum\u00ae is classified as food for special medicinal purposes (FSMP) by the European Union an din other countries.\n\nMany tumors show elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) compared to the surrounding tissue due to vascular leakage, providing a barrier for drug uptake in solid tumors, as well as poor perfusion, resulting in hypoxia and relative resistance to radiochemotherapy.\n\nAF-16 was reported to significantly reduce the IFP in xenotransplanted human glioblastoma by inhibiting an ionic pump, NKCC1, in the tumor tissue. Both Salovum\u00ae and AF-inducing specific processed cereals (SPC) prolonged survival in the same models. Systemic temozolomide treatment combined with AF inducing SPC completely blocked tumor growth in GBM xenografts. Likewise, SPC treatment abrogated 90% of pre-established syngeneic tumors in immune competent animals.\n\nIntratumoral delivery of AF-16 potentiated the effect of intratumoral temozolomide in an experimental model of glioblastoma.\n\nMechanistically, it remains unclear whether AF's effect in tumor models is mediated through decrease of IFP and/or immunomodulation. Also, an effect on the complement system through modulation of circulating complement complexes with proteasome units has been proposed.\n\nSalovum\u00ae has been administered to patients with various diseases as, inflammatory bowel disease, Mb M\u00e9ni\u00e8re and mastitis and traumatic brain injury without signs of any adverse effects.\n\nIn a completed phase1-2 trial in participants with primary gliobalstoma the add on of Salovum during concomitant radiochemotherapa was considered safe and feasible.\n\nThe current study is aimed at assessing the efficacy of Salovum in a RCT (randomised controlled trail).",

They will be administered daily ropidoxuridine at two dose levels: either 960 mg or 1200 mg. This administration will occur 5 days a week, from Monday to Friday. Treatment with ropidoxuridine will start one week before radiotherapy (induction period) and continue concomitantly with 60 Gy standard radiotherapy fractionated in 2 Gy daily doses (Monday through Friday weeks 2 to 7, treatment period)), followed by a 4-week rest period. Following completion of this 11-week active study period, maintenance therapy, including temozolomide, tumor treating field device (Optune\u00ae), or other available treatment modalities, may be initiated at the discretion of the Investigator.\n\nAnalysis of the pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability data for the two cohorts will determine the optimal dose of ropidoxuridine, to be administered to the next cohort of 14 patients for determination of efficacy, compared to historical controls.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) will be performed at the end of the active study period (Week 11). This MRI should not be used for disease assessment due to increased contrast enhancement in the acute radiation reaction phase, unless there is evidence of progression outside the radiotherapy fields. Radiographic disease assessment will be performed in accordance with community standard of care guidelines, every 3 months until disease progression. After the confirmed disease progression, survival monitoring follow-ups will occur every three months.",

    "brief_summary": "This study is a clinical trial to determine the safety of inoculating G207 (an experimental virus therapy) into a recurrent or refractory cerebellar brain tumor. The safety of combining G207 with a single low dose of radiation, designed to enhance virus replication, tumor cell killing, and an anti-tumor immune response, will also be tested.\n\nFunding Source- FDA OOPD",
    "detailed_description": "Outcomes for children with recurrent or progressive cerebellar malignant brain tumors are very poor, and there are a lack of effective salvage therapies once a patient fails standard treatments. G207 is an oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV) that has been successfully engineered to introduce mutations in the virus that enable it to selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells. Replication of G207 in the tumor not only kills the infected tumor cells, but causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus engenders an anti-tumor immune response; the virus is immunogenic and produces a debris field which exposes cancer cell antigens to immune cells which can target other cancer cells. Thus, the oncolytic effect of the virus and the immune response that the virus stimulates provide a \"one-two punch\" at attacking cancer cells. In preclinical studies, a single 5 Gy dose of radiation within 24 hours of virus inoculation to the tumor increased virus replication and tumor cell killing.\n\nThe safety of G207 has been demonstrated in 3 phase I clinical trials involving adults with supratentorial high-grade gliomas adults at the University of Alabama (UAB) and in an ongoing (closed to accrual) phase I clinical trial involving children with recurrent supratentorial brain tumors at Children's of Alabama. In the adult trials, high doses (up to 3 x 10\\^9 plaque-forming units) of virus were safely injected directly into the tumor or surrounding brain tissue without serious toxicities. Radiographic and neuropathologic evidence of anti-tumor responses have been seen. Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of aggressive pediatric brain tumor types are sensitive to G207.\n\nThis study is a phase I, open-label, single institution clinical trial of G207 alone or combined with a single low dose of radiation in children and young adults, ages 3 to 21 years, with recurrent or progressive cerebellar brain tumors. The primary goal is to determine safety. The secondary aims are to obtain preliminary information on the effectiveness of and immune response to G207. A traditional 3 + 3 design will be used with four patient cohorts. The first cohort will receive G207 alone, and the next cohorts will receive G207 at one of three doses followed by a 5 Gy dose of radiation to active areas of tumor.",

A team recently showed that baseline plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were correlated to bevacizumab activity in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. To date, the biological rationale of this results remains unknown but MMP2 could be involved in classical angiogenesis while MMP9 could promote vasculogenesis.\n\nThe objectives are to correlate the plasma levels of MMP2 and MMP9 to their Ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein tissue expression, activity and to patient neuro-imaging features. To analyze the changes of MMP2 and MMP9 plasma levels during peri-operative period and after radio-chemotherapy.\n\nMethods: Plasmatic levels of MMP2, MMP9, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor-R2 (VEGFR2), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in pre-, post-operative period, before radiotherapy, before adjuvant temozolomide and at relapse in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. RNA expression of these factors will be analyzed by reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on frozen tumor samples, whereas protein expression will be analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Enzymatic activity of MMP2 and MMP9 will be analyzed by zymography. Tumor volume, infiltration and perfusion degrees will be analyzed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed before and after surgery and before adjuvant temozolomide. Neuro-imaging characteristics will be correlated to plasma and tissue expressions of these factors.\n\nThe expected results are to better define the expression profile of MMP2, MMP9 and the change in their plasma level during treatment, a prerequisite for their clinical use.",

    "detailed_description": "There were an estimated 22,000 new cases of brain cancers in 2015 in the United States, and 15,000 deaths (Howlader et al., 2014). Glioblastoma (WHO IV), and Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO III), are the most common brain cancers, respectively, representing over 70% of all malignant gliomas (ABTA, 2015).\n\nThough rare, there is no cure, and the prognosis for these tumors is poor. Survival at 5 years for all CNS cancers is approximately 33.3 % (Howlader et al., 2014). For GBM, the most lethal of the tumors, with the current standard of care median survival is 14.6 months (Walid, 2008). Relative survival with GBM at five years is approximately only 5% (Ostrom et al. CBTRUS 2014).\n\nFor newly diagnosed tumors, the current standard of care recommends a multi-modal approach with surgery to remove the tumor, when possible, followed by 6 weeks of radiation and a concurrent daily dose of temozolomide (Stupp et al. 2005). This is known as the Stupp protocol (Stupp et al. 2005). Patients then have a one-month rest period with no treatment, followed by \"maintenance\" temozolomide, given five days out of every 28 days, for a minimum of six months. Some providers keep patients on temozolomide beyond 6 months, or until disease progression.\n\nTherefore, more therapies are needed to help improve survival, reduce time to recurrence and improve quality of life for these patients. This trial proposes to improve the current standard of care by enhancing the efficacy of an active drug temozolomide, currently used for treatment of GBM.",

    "detailed_description": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a by-product of cysteine metabolism, inhibits the growth of cultured glioblastoma cells and impairs progression of glioblastoma tumors developing in vivo in laboratory mice. Additionally, endogenous H2S production and signaling via protein sulfhydration are decreased in human glioblastoma brain tissues compared to non-cancerous brain tissue. Thus, boosting H2S levels is a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastoma. The use of exogenous H2S is difficult to translate to the clinic due to toxicity and volatility. Therefore, bolstering endogenous H2S synthesis and signaling represents a safe and promising method to mitigate disease progression. Based on previously published data, which detailed the use of the thyroid hormone inhibitor propylthiouracil (PTU) to enhance endogenous H2S production in mice, and a previous clinical trial at CCF utilizing PTU to increase the survival of glioblastoma patients, revisiting the use of thyroid hormone inhibitors to de-repress endogenous H2S production concurrent with standards of care poses a novel therapeutic avenue. In the nearly two decades since the aforementioned clinical trial, PTU has been largely replaced in clinical endocrinology by the safer and more efficient thyroid inhibitor methimazole. Given our recent success elucidating the importance of tumor suppressive H2S in the realm of GBM, it is hypothesized that reduced thyroid hormone production via oral methimazole intake will bolster the effectiveness of frontline therapy and extend survival by boosting H2S production and function within the tumor-bearing brain. The goal of this trial is to provide proof of the concept that suppression of thyroid hormone signaling via methimazole and subsequent augmentation of H2S synthesis and signaling is feasible in patients with glioblastoma. Achievement of this goal will motivate and guide further therapeutic development of this combinatorial therapeutic approach.",

    "detailed_description": "Gliomas, heterogeneous and aggressive tumors awaiting new therapeutic approaches.\n\nGliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors, with 2,500 to 3,000 new cases per year in France. They concern the elderly but can also affect children and young adults. Their diagnosis is often complex (differential diagnoses, delicate classification). However, this diagnosis is essential to determine the therapeutic management. Thus, while grade I gliomas (infrequent) are curable by surgery or have a slow progression, grades II to IV have a cost in terms of therapeutic costs (surgery and radio-chemotherapy), in connection with a prognosis ranging from heavy 10-15 years for grades II to only 15 months for glioblastoma (grade IV). New biotherapies (such as anti-VEGF) have not improved the prognosis and to date there are no targeted therapies or immune systems that have shown a benefit.\n\nIt is more than ever necessary to propose targeted treatments against alterations of each type of glioma and to develop in parallel the therapeutic tests allowing their prescription.\n\nDIAGNOSIS OF GLIOMAS: IMPORTANCE OF BIOMARKERS\n\nThe diagnosis of gliomas was subject to a high rate of inter-observer discrepancies. Molecular criteria have recently made it possible to refine and secure the diagnosis1. Thus, in hospital routine, mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenases (IDH1 and 2), 1p19q deletion, EGFR amplification, loss of CDKN2A, mutations in histones H3.3 and H3.1 (G35R / V, K28M), methylation of MGMT, as well as two telomeric markers: mutations of the TERT promoter (TERTmt) and the deletion of ATRX (lost ATRX) (see below). Thus, the new \"histo-molecular\" classification of WHO1 (2016) and its following updates define different classes of gliomas:\n\n* Oligodendrogliomas (OD) (IDHmt, 1p19q lost) (grades II-III)\n* IDHmt (A) Astrocytomas (IDHmt and ATRXperdu / TP53 positive) (grades II-III)\n* IDHmt Glioblastomas (GBM IDHmt) (IDHmt and ATRXperdu) (grade IV)\n* IDHwt (GBM) Glioblastomas (IDHwt and TERTmt) (grade IV)\n* IDHwt Astrocytomas (A IDHwt) (IDHwt) (grades II-III)\n* midline mutated histone gliomas (G35R / V, K28M)\n\nHowever, this classification does not fully reflect the actual aggressiveness of the tumors and has prognostic insufficiencies. Adaptations are therefore regularly made to these initial categories. Despite these diagnostic adaptations, some tumors present discrepancies between the immunohistological and molecular diagnosis, they are annotated NEC (Not Elsewhere Classified).\n\nLIQUID BIOPSY: AN EXPECTED DIAGNOSIS TOOL FOR GLIOMAS\n\nLiquid biopsy-type approaches have rapidly developed in the clinic; they already make it possible to monitor and / or participate in the diagnosis of various cancers on a routine basis (eg: EGFR mutations in lung cancers). In the case of gliomas, their benefit is obvious: in addition to imaging, or as a replacement for stereotaxic biopsy (1% mortality), they could improve the quality of follow-up and speed up the initial diagnosis. In particular, 47% of patients with GBM have an MRI imaging suggesting progression after radiotherapy, the detection of a circulating marker would make it possible to differentiate a progression (27%) from a \"pseudo-progression\" (20%). When monitoring gliomas, the reappearance of the circulating marker would make it possible to objectify the recurrence and to set up a second line or inclusion in a clinical trial more quickly. Finally, during the initial diagnosis, the delay of one month after biopsy or surgery necessary for the conventional diagnostic circuit could be reduced to one week thanks to this type of test; therapeutic management could then be accelerated.\n\nAt this time, there is no such test for gliomas. However, preliminary studies carried out on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected during surgery show a sensitivity of around 100% for the detection of TERTmt9. However, the removal of LCS for follow-up is an invasive act to which we should favor approaches by blood sampling.\n\nThe first studies of this type on circulating DNA (cfDNA) in plasma, via whole exome sequencing (a very expensive technique) detected gene abnormalities in nearly 50% of the cfDNAs analyzed. However, detection of diagnostic hotspots characteristic of gliomas such as TERTmt is insufficient on cfDNA (0-8% detection for glioblastomas). Other studies have looked at the analysis of tumor DNA carried by exosome-like vesicles, but have not been satisfactory. Finally, an alternative is based on the purification of circulating tumor cells (CTC). The latter have been detected in nearly 77% of gliomas; the best results having been obtained using density gradient centrifugation techniques, such as that offered by the OncoQuick kits combining a density gradient with filtration. Using this technique, from 1 to 10 CTC per 7.5 ml of blood were detected in 31 patients with gliomas of different grades. The advantage of this approach is that it preserves the entire genome of the tumor cell and will therefore allow the identification of characteristic diagnostic hotspots such as TERTmt and IDH1 / 2mt. The search for these mutations will then be objectivable by inexpensive techniques (such as the digital PCR droplet), already used routinely and not by high-throughput techniques (eg: whole genome sequencing) unsuitable for routine.\n\nThere is therefore a real expectation regarding liquid biopsies for the diagnosis and follow-up of gliomas. The targeted research approach for hotspot alterations with diagnostic value in glioma (such as TERTmt and IDH1 / 2mt), via CTC enrichment appears to be a promising avenue.",

    "brief_summary": "The usual standard of care for patients over 65 diagnosed with glioblastoma (\"GBM\") or Grade 4 astrocytoma, IDH-mutant is a 3-week course of radiotherapy, with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). This radiation dose and length of treatment are less than what would be given for younger patients, primarily due to unclear survival benefits from randomized trials. However, survival remains dismal, and may be partially due to the reduced radiation dose. Recent studies investigating this have found that increased radiation dose (to the equivalent of what is normally given over 6 weeks in younger patients) over 3 weeks is well-tolerated and has improved survival rates.\n\nAdditionally, with the advent of novel technology such as the MR-Linac, adaptive radiotherapy with this regimen using reduced radiation margins is possible. Use of the MR-Linac allows for daily MRI scans to be done prior to treatment, so plans can be adapted to tumour dynamics and anatomical deformations. In this trial, we will examine the outcomes of increased radiation dose, combined with reduced-margin adaptive radiotherapy in this patient population.",

    "detailed_description": "Brain tumors are the first cause of cancer mortality in children and the 3rd cause in young adults. The most frequent brain tumors are gliomas and among them the most common type is astrocytoma. The most malignant astrocytoma is Glioblastoma (GBM). Standard therapy of newly diagnosed GBM patients includes surgery, irradiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy with 1-year and 5-year survival rates at 30% and 3%, respectively. For the treatment of recurrent GBM, TMZ is widely used even if the optimal dosing schedule and the minimal time interval from first line are unknown. Other appropriate therapeutic options include Lomustine, an alkylating drug, and Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent targeting VEGF-A, approved only in selected countries (i.e. North America, Switzerland). Controlled trials are rare for recurrent glioblastoma, consequently therapeutic decisions are mostly based on low-level evidence.\n\nAmongst innovative strategies, immunotherapy is considered as one of the most promising. Immunotherapy stimulates the natural properties of the immune system to protect against cancer growth. Therapeutic vaccines (active immunotherapy) are expected to elicit a cytotoxic immune response to tumor-associated antigens, destroying malignant cells without harming normal cells. The cells involved in this response are T lymphocytes, which can sense abnormal peptides at the tumor cells surface. One critical step towards the development of therapeutic vaccines was the identification and validation of glioma antigens. This is an obstacle the investigators have circumvented with the characterization of several immunogenic glioma peptides by screening the peptidome of ex vivo human glioma samples. This led to the development of a multipeptide vaccine called IMA950.\n\nIMA950 is composed of 9 synthetic tumor-associated HLA-A2-restricted peptides (TUMAPs), two MHC class II-binding peptides and one HLA-A2-restricted HBV-derived peptide, the latter used as marker of vaccine immunogenicity. The HLA-A2 allele is expressed by approximately 45% of the Swiss population. As the interactions between peptides and their corresponding HLA molecule are highly specific, only HLA-A\\*02 positive patients will be included in this trial. The reasons why this set of peptides is very promising for vaccination are as follows:\n\n1. Tumor peptides have been isolated from ex vivo samples:\n2. They are over-expressed in glioma (compared to normal tissues)\n3. They are derived from proteins involved in the malignant process\n4. They are immunogenic in vitro in healthy donors and in glioma patients\n5. This is a MULTI-peptide vaccine IMA950 was investigated in a monocentric phase I/II trial for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and WHO grade III gliomas using poly-ICLC as adjuvant (PI: P-Y. Dietrich, NCT01920191, study completed, final results in preparation for publication). A total of 19 patients (16 with GBM and 3 with anaplastic astrocytoma) were included, with a median number of 9 injections received per patient (range: 4-11). The multipeptide vaccine did not show any serious safety issues, apart from some mild inflammatory reactions at the injection site, peritumoral or resection cavity edema/tumor flare manageable with steroids, as well as peri-vaccinational transient mild headache, fatigue and flu-like syndrome (grade 3 events: 42.1%, grade 4 events: 21%, no grade 5 events). Regarding vaccine immunogenicity, CD4 T-cell responses were detected in the majority of patients (58%) and were usually sustained. The CD8 T-cell responses were detected in 63% of patients, with 37% of them being multi-TUMAP responders. Median overall survival from date of surgery was 21 months (range: 10 - 41 months) for the overall cohort, with a 19 months survival for the GBM-only cohort (range: 10-41 months), which compares favorably with the reported median survival of 15 months with the reference treatment of temozolomide-based chemoradiation. PFS was 93% and 56% at 6 and 9 months respectively.\n\nDespite the T cell ability to detect tumor peptides that are naturally presented by tumor cells, these T cells do not normally become activated and do not protect the body against the cancer, as tumor cells on their own are only poorly immunogenic. For effective T cell activation, the help of co-stimulatory molecules, which are expressed on activated professional APCs, e.g. dendritic cells, is required. During infections, the activation of APCs is triggered by molecular patterns common to all pathogens of a class (e.g. RNA viruses). These patterns, also referred to as \"danger signals\", are not provided by peptides themselves. Consequently, artificial danger signals have to be provided with a tumor vaccine to induce the required co-stimulation on APCs. In combination with a vaccine, such substances with a non-specific immunostimulatory effect are called adjuvants. Poly-ICLC, (Hiltonol\u00ae, Oncovir) is a synthetic double-stranded ribo-nucleic acid (dsRNA) mimicking viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) that activates multiple elements of innate and adaptive immunity.\n\nThe importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic cells has been known for decades. The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-regulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. Binding of PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) to the PD-1 receptor inhibits T-cell activation triggered through the T-cell receptor. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u2122) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands. Impressive response rate and prolonged survival were first observed for metastatic melanoma, but the clinical benefit of this mAb was recently shown to extend to several other cancer types. There is a strong rationale to investigate the role of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in malignant glioma, since (i) we and others have previously reported that PD-L1 expression by glioma cells may contribute to tumor-related immunoresistance; (ii) PD-L1 is also expressed by tumor-infiltrating macrophages and circulating monocytes; (iii) expression of PD-L1 on circulating monocytes was shown to correlate with worsened survival in patients who received the HSPPC-96 vaccine for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. The 200 mg Q3W dose will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range demonstrated to be well tolerated, safe and established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response. A fixed dose regimen simplifies the dosing regimen so as to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce the potential for dosing errors.\n\nThe combination of pembrolizumab with a vaccine therapy is currently being tested in several trials for different tumors, such as melanoma, bladder, colorectal and prostate cancer (NCT02574533, NCT02054520, NCT02432963, NCT02499835, NCT02515227). Here the investigators postulate that Pembrolizumab may improve the immunogenicity of the IMA950 vaccine and the function of vaccine-induced glioma-specific T cells, and that the multipeptide vaccine may help to focus the immune response against antigens overexpressed by glioma, leading together to an optimization of the antitumor immune effect whilst reducing the risk of collateral damage to the brain.\n\nThe study aims to answer questions regarding safety (for the future clinical development of this strategy), immunogenicity (synergy between multipeptide vaccine and pembrolizumab) and clinical outcome. Ancillary translational research should help to identify possible correlation between neo-epitopes, methylation status, immune response and clinical outcome.",

We therefore postulated that Nimotuzumab in combination with conventional definitive chemotherapy might improve the rate of disease control (RDC), progression-free survival (PFS),and overall survival in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN , which is a poor-prognosis patient population for whom there is currently no standard treatment approach, we designed this trial to test this hypothesis.",

Combination arm chemotherapy was as conducted as follows. Since day 1, Nimotuzumab (200 mg, given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion before chemotherapy, Biotech Pharmaceutical Inc., Beijing, China) was administrated 1 h before chemotherapy once a week for two successive courses, followed by docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area) was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion, followed by intravenous cisplatin (75 mg per square meter), administered during a period of 0.5 to 3 hours. After completion of the cisplatin infusion, fluorouracil (1000 mg per square meter per day) was administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 4 days. Patients in arm A received docetaxel-cisplatin-fluorouracil only.One treatment cycle comprised a period of 3 weeks (21 days). Patients received six cycles in both treatment arms, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Patients in the experimental group who had at least stable disease could choose to continue maintenance Nimotuzumab every week until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or study withdrawal.",

    "brief_summary": "A recent prospective multicenter study by Dr. Grossman demonstrated that 40% of patients with high grade glioma undergoing radiation and chemotherapy developed severe and persistent lymphopenia (CD4 counts \\<200 cells/mm3). This lymphopenia lasted for twelve months following radiation treatment and on multivariate analysis was associated with shorter survival. Our group has data that strongly suggests that this lymphopenia is secondary to the inadvertent radiation of circulating lymphocytes as they pass through the radiation beam. Investigators propose the use of FDA approved for multiple sclerosis, fingolimod to signal lymphocytes to leave the circulation prior to the initiation of radiation. It is a functional antagonist of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) pathway and prevents lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nOral fingolimod will be given 1 week prior to the initiation of concurrent radiation and temozolomide and will be discontinued immediately upon completion of the six weeks of therapy. The primary objective is to evaluate if fingolimod can be safely combined with radiation and temozolomide. Secondary endpoint is total lymphocyte counts (TLC) for the proposed study participants. Investigators expect that patients receiving radiation and temozolomide plus fingolimod have a recovery of lymphocyte counts to 80% of baseline within four months, reference to historical control in which sustained lymphopenia lasted for twelve months.",
    "detailed_description": "Five evaluable patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas who will undergo standard concomitant radiation and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide will be accrued to this open-label, single arm, safety study. Oral fingolimod will be given 1 week prior to the initiation of concurrent radiation and temozolomide and will be discontinued immediately upon completion of the six weeks of therapy.\n\nThe primary objective is to evaluate if fingolimod can be safely combined with radiation and temozolomide. This standard chemoradiation causes 40% of patients to develop severe lymphopenia two months after initiation of therapy. Investigators expect that when this is combined with fingolimod, virtually all patients will have severe lymphopenia two months after beginning treatment. Investigators will determine if these patients who routinely receive pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis develop other severe opportunistic infections that would prohibit further evaluation of this novel treatment approach. Primary endpoint is incidence of greater than or equal to Grade III infections attributable to fingolimod-induced lymphopenia defined by the NIH/NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) within four months of starting fingolimod.\n\nThe secondary objective is to obtain preliminary information regarding the ability of fingolimod to reduce radiation-related lymphopenia three months after stopping fingolimod. The NIH funded Adult Brain Tumor Consortium (ABTC) followed total lymphocyte and CD4 counts in 96 patients after treatment with radiation and temozolomide. The severe lymphopenia (CD4 count less than 200/mm3) lasted for twelve months in this historical control. Secondary endpoint is total lymphocyte counts (TLC) for the proposed study participants. These will be compared with patient level data on TLC from an historical cohort obtained from the ABTC. Investigators expect that patients receiving radiation and temozolomide plus fingolimod have a recovery of lymphocyte counts to 80% of baseline within four months, reference to historical control in which sustained lymphopenia lasted for twelve months.\n\nInvestigators will also obtain laboratory analysis on lymphocyte subtypes and cytokine levels (CD3, CD4, CD8, IL-7, TGF-Beta, etc.).

    "brief_summary": "The prognosis of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is dismal despite recent therapeutic improvements Using standard therapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (60 Gy), the median overall survival time (mOS) is 14.6 months (Stupp et al., 2005). Since in a previous non-randomized bicentric phase II trial, primary combination chemotherapy with lomustine (CCNU) and TMZ was highly effective (mOS 23 months; UKT-03 trial; Herrlinger et al., 2006; Glas et al., 2009) the proposed trial further investigates the efficacy of CCNU/TMZ in a randomized multicenter phase III setting against standard therapy. In case the projected phase III trial confirms the phase II data, CCNU/TMZ combination would be significantly better than TMZ monotherapy and would thus be the new standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM patients with a methylated MGMT promotor. Thus, this trial has the potential to profoundly change the standard therapy of this most aggressive brain tumor. Since in the previous trial only patients with a methylated MGMT (mMGMT) promoter had a benefit from CCNU/TMZ (mOS in the mMGMT group 34 months, in the non-mMGMT group 12.5 months; Glas et al., 2009) while patients with a non-methylated MGMT did not have any benefit, the trial is restricted to mMGMT patients.The CeTeG trial randomizes in a 1:1 fashion newly diagnosed GBM patients (18-70 years) for either standard TMZ therapy (concomitant and 6 courses \u00e0 4 weeks of adjuvant TMZ therapy) or experimental CCNU/TMZ therapy (6 courses \u00e0 6 weeks). Both arms include standard radiotherapy (RT) of the tumor site (30 x 2 Gy). Assuming that CCNU/TMZ therapy increases the median overall survival (mOS) from 48.9% (standard TMZ) to 70% (CCNU/TMZ; 75% in the previous phase II trial, Glas et al., 2009), 2 x 68 patients have to be accrued. Patients will be accrued over 24 months and each patient will be followed for at least 24 months adding up to a total minimal duration of the time from first patient in until the end of the follow-up time of 48 months. The primary endpoint is overall survival; secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, response rate, acute and late toxicity, and quality of life.",

    "detailed_description": "Vaccination represents a success story in modern medicine and its principles have been found to be valid in different species, at least in the case of infectious diseases. As of today, there is little reason to believe that this would not be true in the case of tumours. It is now generally acknowledged that human tumours carry a mutational antigenic (non-self) repertoire of immunogenic potential that may be a suitable target for antitumour immune therapy. During the last years accumulating evidence from mouse experiments indicates that one can immunise prophylactically against cancers as effectively as against an infectious agent. However, in contrast to most experimental mouse tumour models, human tumours have in general been within their host for a long time and thus had the opportunity to influence their microenvironment and the larger immunological environment. Antigens capable of mediating specific rejection were found in human as well as in mouse tumours.\n\nMany of the clinical trials using dendritic cell (DC) -based cancer vaccination techniques were designed for the treatment of melanoma. Other important diseases in which DC-based cancer vaccination was studied include prostate cancer, B cell lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioma and glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and selected solid paediatric tumours. In most of these trials some in vivo and/or in vitro evidence for the generation of anti-tumour immunity was found and even complete or partial remission of the tumour was observed in selected cases. The first phase III trial demonstrating the efficacy of DC cancer vaccination for the treatment of prostate cancer was reported recently (www.dendreon.com). Also patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme appear to benefit from DC cancer immune therapy. The side effects observed in DC cancer vaccinations were usually described to be mild and not limiting the application.\n\nWe developed a DC cancer vaccine technology, Trivax, advancing the design of DC cancer immune therapy in one critical aspect. It is the first such vaccine that is enable for releasing the immune modulatory cytokine interleukin (IL) -12. Trivax is comprised of IL-12 secreting DCs and a mixture of protein tumour antigens derived from the individual patient's tumour cells. No synthetic tumour antigen component is involved. Both components of Trivax are derived from the individual patient and are used for the treatment of only this patient. Trivax therefore represents a fully individualised somatic cell therapy medicine. Trimed's early clinical evaluations in patients suffering from kidney cancer, prostate cancer, bone tumours, and malignancies of childhood have confirmed the safety and the feasibility of the Trivax technology.\n\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (ICD-O M9440/3) is the most malignant astrocytic tumour, composed of poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes. Histopathological features include cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, brisk mitotic activity, vascular thrombosis, micro-vascular proliferation and necrosis. GBM typically affects patients of various age beginning in childhood and up to high age. It is preferentially located in the cerebral hemispheres. GBM may develop from diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II or anaplastic astrocytomas (secondary GBM), but more frequently, they manifest after a short clinical history de novo, without evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary GBM). In spite of modern oncological treatment, the prognosis of GBM remains dismal, with a median survival of little over 1 year.\n\nGBM-Vax is a randomised, open-label, 2-arm, multi-centre, phase II clinical study with both groups undergoing surgery and receiving standard therapy with Temozolomide and radiotherapy; and the treatment group that in addition to the standard therapy receives cancer immune therapy with Trivax. Our aim is to extend therapy options presently including surgery, irradiation and Temozolomide with DC cancer vaccination to improve the poor prognosis of patients with GBM.\n\nPrimary objective\n\n\u2022 Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly diagnosed GBM 12 months after a post-operative MRI scan treated according to the current standard (surgical resection, irradiation, oral chemo-therapy with Temozolomide), and Trivax, an autologous DC cancer vaccine charged with autologous tumour protein, as add-on therapy (group A), in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax (group B).\n\nSecondary objectives\n\n* Progression free survival measured as percentage of non-progressive patients with newly diagnosed GBM 18 and 24 months after a post-operative MRI scan receiving standard treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy (group A), in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax (group B).\n* Extension of overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM receiving standard treatment and Trivax as add-on therapy, in comparison to patients receiving standard treatment without Trivax.\n* Quality of life in patients treated with Trivax as an add-on therapy using ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status compared to qual-ity of life of patients receiving standard therapy (for study patients older 18 years).\n\nNumber of subjects In total, 56 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 2 arms and at least 28 patients should be randomly assigned to one of the two arms. It is expected to recruit the study patients within a period of one year. Randomisation is based on stratification according to study sites at a 1:1 ratio. Patients younger than 18 years will not be randomised but will all receive add-on therapy with Trivax. We feel that it would be not just to expect from children to understand and accept that there is a new treatment available but only every second patient will receive it. Obviously, patients younger than 18 years will not be analysed together with adult patients in the context of the study; and paediatric patients will not count towards the recruiting number of 2 x 28. Thus, the results obtained in paediatric GBM patients will not influence the outcome of the study in patients older than 18 years.",

    "detailed_description": "* Background: 18FDG is the most widely used tracer for oncologic positron emission tomography (PET). However, the high glucose utilization of normal gray matter limits its utility in brain explorations. More recently, 18FLT was introduced as a PET tracer for tumor imaging. It has been found useful for non-invasive assessment of the proliferation status of various tumors. Its potential clinical use in the evaluation of brain tumors has not been clearly determined because of sparse studies.\n* The primary objective of this study is to assess the positive predictive value of PET-CT uptake of 18FLT in diagnosing malignant tissue by comparison with the histopathological gold standard diagnosis according to the WHO grading malignancy scale and the Ki-67 proliferation index, at the time of preoperative evaluation.\n* Secondary objectives are: to describe and compare preoperative tumor volumes and postoperative residual tumor volumes as assessed by 18FLT PET-CT and MRI, and to describe a quantitative proliferation index with PET (SUV for \"standardized uptake value\").\n* Study design: This is an exploratory cross-sectional study at two separate times: pre-and postoperative. Eligible patients will be included consecutively. Histological samples will be analyzed blindly to imaging data. Assessments of PET-CT and MRI volumes will be blind to each other.\n* Procedure: After information and written informed consent and before surgery, patients will undergo MRI and 18F-FLT PET-CT to obtain the tumor volume according to both modalities. Then, surgeons will make different biopsies from i) areas with MR abnormalities and FLT uptake, ii) area with FLT uptake and no MR abnormality (on the surgery approach way or in not functional areas), iii) area with MR abnormality without any FLT uptake, iiii) area without any uptake where biopsy is possible because the area is on the surgery approach way. Then, the samples will be blindly analyzed to determine the Ki-67 proliferation index and WHO grading malignancy scale. Patients will undergo again 18F-FLT PET-TDM and MRI at least 4 weeks after surgery, in the week preceding radiotherapy, to determine residual tumor volumes.",

This retrospective cohort study included 127 patients with newly diagnosed primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNSL) and 586 patients with newly diagnosed glioma, treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, between 2016 and 2024. Patients included in this study met the following criteria: (1) HIV-seronegative status; (2) no history of immunosuppression or organ transplantation; (3) availability of all clinical indicators prior to the first surgery; (4) sufficient clinical and data availability. All participants were informed of the study's purpose and provided signed informed consent prior to participation, in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nBasic demographic and clinical data were collected prior to initial diagnosis and first surgical treatment. Demographic data included age and sex, while clinical data encompassed peripheral white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NEUT1), lymphocyte ratio (LYMPH1), neutrophil count (NEUT), lymphocyte count (LYMPH), monocyte count (MONO), international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT) and albumin.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio for both diagnostic models, comprising 713 and 586 patients, respectively. No significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics were observed between the training and validation sets. To identify potential predictors, LASSO regression analysis was performed on the training set, effectively eliminating several irrelevant or multicollinear independent variables to reduce dimensionality. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the characteristic variables. Finally, a nomogram was constructed based on the training set and validated in the validation set.\n\nThe predictive performance of the model was assessed and validated using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Model discrimination was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to assess the model's net benefit and clinical utility.\n\nCategorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. Chi-squared tests or t-tests were used to compare data between the two cohorts. A LASSO regression model was applied to mitigate potential multicollinearity. All variables with complete data in the training cohort were included in the LASSO regression analysis using the \"glmnet\" package in R software. The model achieved optimal performance at Lambda.min, thus identifying candidate variables. Subsequently, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors associated with the binary outcome. These factors were then integrated to construct a nomogram prediction model using the \"rms\" package in R software. Seven additional models-logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), neural network, XGBoost, and LightGBM-were constructed using the \"caret\" package, and decision curves were generated using the \"rmda\" package. All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.4.2, and a p-value \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Our previous study provided evidence for a potential benefit of apatinib, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGFR-2, when added to temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Some patients showed durable responses and prolonged survival, with recorded survival times of over 30 months in 6.4% patients. However, a subset of patients progressed in 2 months. There is a strong need to better predict and monitor apatinib treatment response to prevent patients from adverse effects of ineffective therapy. In this study, whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor materials from the participants who received apatinib and temozolomide treatment will be performed to identify the response biomarkers and patients who may benefit most from apatinib, avoiding unnecessary potential toxicity and cost for those who are unlikely to benefit from the drug.",

    "brief_summary": "Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers but result in a disproportionate share of cancer morbidity and mortality. The five-year survival rates for the most common histologic subtypes, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM), are 30% and 10%, respectively.\n\nDrugs affecting transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) might be of great interest for malignant glioma treatment. TGF-\u03b2 is an oncogenic factor in advanced tumors where it induces proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis as well as suppresses the antitumoral immune response. In addition TGF-\u03b2 and its TGF-\u03b2 receptors, T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, are overexpressed in GBMs. TGF-\u03b2 signaling is involved in multiple steps of GBM development. GC1008 is an antibody that is capable of neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 and may therefore offer a new treatment option for patients with malignant glioma.\n\nFor therapeutic success, it may be essential for GC1008 to reach the target site, in this case located in the brain. We will be able to prove this with 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging. This imaging method also allows quantification of the amount of GC1008 reaching the tumor.\n\nThis study consists of 2 parts. In part 1, patients with a suspicion of a malignant glioma undergo an 89Zr-GC1008 PET scan before standard (surgical)treatment. In part 2, patients with relapsed malignant glioma will undergo an 89Zr-GC1008 PET scan and will be treated with GC1008 in a phase II study as there is no standard treatment for these patients.\n\nWe hypothesize that GC1008 uptake in brain tumors can be visualized and quantified using the 89Zr-GC1008 PET scan and GC1008 might offer a new treatment option for patients with relapsed malignant gliomas.",
    "detailed_description": "Brain tumors account for only 2% of all cancers but result in a disproportionate share of cancer morbidity and mortality. The five-year survival rates for the most common histologic subtypes, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM), are 30% and 10%, respectively.\n\nAfter surgery, the standard treatment of malignant glioma is focused on cell death induction by DNA damage, neglecting the fact that invasion into surrounding brain tissue is a fundamental feature of and the major reason for treatment failure.\n\nDrugs affecting transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) might be of great interest for malignant glioma treatment. The reason for this is the fact that TGF-\u03b2 acts as a tumor suppressor in normal epithelial cells and early-stage tumors but transforms in an oncogenic factor in advanced tumors where it induces proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis as well as suppresses the antitumoral immune response. In addition TGF-\u03b2 expression and its TGF-\u03b2 receptors, T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, are overexpressed in GBMs. TGF-\u03b2 signaling is involved in multiple steps of GBM development (Golestaneh, Mishra, 2005) and invasion (Wesolowska et al, 2008). Plasma TGF-\u03b2 levels are elevated in GBM patients and decrease after surgical tumor resection (Schneider et al, 2006). Progression-free survival and overall survival are worse for malignant glioma patients with high TGF-\u03b2 signaling compared with glioma patients with low TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity (Bruna et al, 2007). All these features make TGF-\u03b2 a promising target molecule for biological treatment approaches for GBM (Wick et al, 2006). Phase I/II-studies with the TGF-\u03b22-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide AP12009 in malignant glioma showed promising results (Hau et al, 2007). Another approach to target TGF-\u03b2 is with monoclonal antibodies, such as GC1008. GC1008 is a fully human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing all mammalian isoforms of TGF-\u03b2 (i.e., 1, 2, and 3). For therapeutic success, it may be essential for GC1008 to reach the target site, in this case located in the brain. Our own data with 89Zr-bevacizumab, which is also an IgG, showed that the VEGF directed antibody bevacizumab penetrates the brain and is localized in brain metastases. We therefore expect GC1008 to reach the malignant glioma as well. In order to initiate clinical trials with TGF-\u03b2 antibody in these patients it would clearly be of great help to prove that the drug arrives at the tumor site. 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging will allow us to prove this. In addition, PET imaging allows quantification of the amount of GC1008 reaching the malignant glioma. A phase II study with GC1008 in patients with relapsed malignant gliomas will be initiated as currently, there is no standard treatment available for these patients.\n\nStudy objectives:\n\nPart 1: Feasibility of 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging in patients with suspicion of a malignant glioma to assess if GC1008 penetrates into the brain tumor and to quantify its uptake.\n\nPart 2: 89Zr-GC1008 PET imaging in patients with relapsed malignant glioma and phase II extension study with therapeutic GC1008 in these patients.\n\nFor part 1, 12 patients will be included.

On the first day of BMX-001 (loading dose), patients will be evaluated with medical history, patient physical/neurological examinations, and standard laboratory evaluations (CBC with differential and CMP), and ECG. Patients in Arm A will be administered BMX-001 subcutaneously first as a loading dose before the start of chemoradiation and then at maintenance dose (50% of the loading dose) twice a week for 8 weeks. Because oxidative stress continues to occur for up to several weeks following RT, the proposed protocol includes administering BMX-001 both before the start of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after the completion of RT and TMZ. TMZ will be dosed at 75 mg/m2 orally daily for 42 days and RT will be delivered in daily fractions of 1.8-2 Gy given 5 days a week for 6 weeks for a total of 59.4-60 Gy.

Please note: the only portion of the MRI scan that will be research-related are the MRS sequences. The other portion of the imaging will be considered as a standard of care MRI scan that will be reviewed by an attending physician, who will generate an MRI report in the electronic medical record system (EMS). The data collected from the advanced MRS sequences will be reviewed by the principal investigator and will be billed to the research study (you will be billed for the clinical MRI scan as a part of your standard of care).\n\nThe MRI study will be conducted at the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy in the Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. The study scans will be very similar to routine clinical MRI scans of the brain.\n\nThe patient will be asked to lie on a specially designed bed and a circular antenna will be placed around the patients head. The patient will be given earplugs to wear to decrease the banging noise caused by the imaging process. The earplugs do not block out all sound since the MRI tech's wish to stay in communication with the patient at all times. The MRI techs will then move the patient into the magnet, a large hollow cylinder, until the patients head is at the center. The study will then proceed. The MRI operator will inform the patient of the progress of the study. The patient will need to keep perfectly still during the scanning.\n\nDuring each MRI scan, the patient will have an intravenous line (IV line) placed. The IV line allows the contrast agent to be injected into the patient's vein. MRI contrast agents are chemicals that travel through the bloodstream. They act like dyes to make MRI pictures brighter and easier to read.\n\nWhen the study is complete, the patient will be moved out of the magnet. The MRI operator will ask that the patient please get up slowly since the patient has been lying still for a relatively long period of time.\n\nThe investigators will also review the patient's medical records for information about medical history, current and past medications and therapies, and other information related to the patient's GBM.",

    "brief_summary": "High Grade Gliomas, including anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas (GBM), are the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumors. Prognosis for patients with high-grade gliomas remains poor. The estimated median survival for patients with GBM is between 12 to 18 months. Recurrence after initial therapy with temozolomide and radiation is nearly universal. Since May 2009, the majority of patients in the US with an initial recurrence of high-grade glioma receive bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is thought to prevent angiogenesis in these highly vascular tumors. BEV has response rates from 32-62% and has improved overall median survival in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas1. However, the response is short lived, and nearly 100% of patients eventually progress despite bevacizumab. No chemotherapeutic agent administered following progression through bevacizumab has made a significant impact on survival. Patients progress to death within 1-5 months after resistance develops. Therefore, patients with high-grade gliomas who have progressed through bevacizumab represent a population in dire need of a feasible and tolerable treatment.\n\nNKTR-102 is a topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate that was engineered by attaching irinotecan molecules to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer using a biodegradable linker. Irinotecan released from NKTR-102 following administration is further metabolized to the active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), that causes DNA damage through inhibition of topoisomerase. The goal in designing NKTR-102 was to attenuate or eliminate some of the limiting side effects of irinotecan while improving efficacy by modifying the distribution of the agent within the body. The size and structure of NKTR-102 results in marked alteration in pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for the SN38 derived from NKTR-102 compared to that following irinotecan: the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced 5- to 10-fold and the half-life (t1/2 ) of SN38 is increased from 2 days to approximately 50 days. This altered profile leads to constant exposure of the tumor to the active drug. In addition, the large NKTR-102 molecule does not freely pass out of intact vasculature, which may account for relatively higher concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues in in vivo models, where the local vasculature may be relatively more permeable. A 145 mg/m2 dose of NKTR-102, the dose intended for use in this phase II clinical trial (and being used in the phase III clinical program), results in approximately the same plasma exposure to SN38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but exposure is protracted, resulting in continuous exposure between dosing cycles and lower Cmax. NKTR-102 was therefore developed as a new chemotherapeutic agent that may improve the clinical outcomes of patients.",

    "brief_summary": "The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the most effective immunotherapy vaccine components in patients with malignant glioma. Teh investigators previous phase I study (IRB #03-04-053) already confirmed that this vaccine procedure is safe in patients with malignant brain tumors, and with an indication of extended survival in several patients. However, the previous trial design did not allow us to test which formulation of the vaccine was the most effective. This phase II study will attempt to dissect out which components are most effective together. Dendritic cells (DC) (cells which \"present\" or \"show\" cell identifiers to the immune system) isolated from the subject's own blood will be treated with tumor-cell lysate isolated from tumor tissue taken from the same subject during surgery. This pulsing (combining) of antigen-presenting and tumor lysate will be done to try to stimulate the immune system to recognize and destroy the patient's intracranial brain tumor. These pulsed DCs will then be injected back into the patient intradermally as a vaccine. The investigators will also utilize adjuvant imiquimod or poly ICLC (interstitial Cajal-like cell) in some treatment cohorts. It is thought that the host immune system might be taught to \"recognize\" the malignant brain tumor cells as \"foreign\" to the body by effectively presenting unique tumor antigens to the host immune cells (T-cells) in vivo.",

    "brief_summary": "Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME. In eyes with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eye's response to bevacizumab treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity. If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients, clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.\n\nStudy Objectives To compare the efficacy of intravitreous aflibercept with intravitreous bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept if needed in eyes with CI DME and moderate vision loss",

    "brief_summary": "This study is for newly diagnosed WHO Grade IV malignant glioma patients to determine whether an investigational drug known as marizomib (MRZ) will improve the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients by delaying the growth of the cancer, reducing the size of the tumor, and/or improving survival. Marizomib (MRZ) is being added to standard-of-care treatments of radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ), and Optune.",
    "detailed_description": "Gliomas account for \\~80% of primary malignant tumors in the Central Nervous System (CNS), with WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (G4 MG; including glioblastoma and gliosarcoma) constituting the majority of gliomas, and are essentially incurable. Currently only surgical resection and radiotherapy (RT) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) are standard-of-care treatment strategies for newly diagnosed G4 MG. However, resistance to chemotherapy and RT results in a high recurrence rate, with median survival of \\~15-16 months. Since no survival advantage has been demonstrated for the addition of bevacizumab (BEV) to TMZ and RT (Chinot 2014) in newly diagnosed G4 MG, alternative promising investigational agents need to be tested.\n\nTargeting the proteasome is a well-validated target for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), and preclinical evidence suggests that targeting the proteasome in glioma cells shows significant anti-tumor activity. Proteasome activity is elevated in patient-derived glioblastoma (GBM) tissue in comparison with normal human brain. Importantly, preclinical evidence demonstrates that proteasome inhibition sensitizes GBM cell lines to irradiation and to TMZ. Further, the combination of bortezomib (BTZ, one of three proteasome inhibitors \\[PI\\] currently approved for the treatment of MM) with TMZ resulted in synergistic glioblastoma cell death in vitro, and BTZ reduces glioma cell survival in vitro in cell lines sensitive and resistant to TMZ.\n\nDespite the activity against GBM cells in vitro, BTZ does not cross the blood brain barrier, and thus has proven ineffective in animal models and in the clinic. In contrast, marizomib (MRZ) - a potent and irreversible 20S PI possesses the unique attribute among PIs to cross the blood brain barrier as shown in previous clinical studies. These data prompted examination of the combination of MRZ and BEV in an ongoing clinical trial in patients with recurrent G4 MG. In the dose-escalation portion of this ongoing study (MRZ-108), 12 patients were dosed with MRZ once weekly for 3 weeks (0.55, 0.7, and 0.8 mg/m2 infused intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes) and with BEV on weeks 1 and 3 (10 mg/kg IV) of a 28-day cycle. As of April 2016, of these 12 patients, 7 were on study for over 4 months - 5 with a partial response (including 2 patients with no radiologic evidence of tumor on 2 or more consecutive MRI scans) and 2 patients whose best response was stable disease. Four of these 12 patients were treated for over 6 months, 3 of whom remain on study. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MRZ was determined to be 0.8 mg/m2. Currently, an expansion cohort of 24 patients has been enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study. The next phase involves treatment with MRZ alone (no BEV) in patients with recurrent G4 MG, and has begun enrolling patients in the second quarter of 2016.\n\nTogether, the demonstrated activity of PIs in preclinical glioma models, and the synergistic activity of PIs with TMZ on glioblastoma cells, along with the ability of MRZ to access the CNS, provides compelling rationale to assess the therapeutic benefit of the combination of MRZ with TMZ in patients with G4 MG, for whom no brain-penetrant options for proteasome inhibition are currently available.\n\nVery recently, the FDA has approved a novel treatment device using tumor treating fields (Optune) in addition to standard of care RTand TMZ as an option to standard of care. Optune has been shown to significantly improve both progression-free and overall survival in GBM patients. An additional cohort of 12 patients will be treated with Optune in combination with MRZ and TMZ In North America, the Optune arm is offered only for the US trial sites, and is not offered for the Canadian trial sites.",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly.\n\n* Trial with medicinal product",
    "detailed_description": "This is a randomized (2:1), explorative, parallel-group, open-label, phase II trial in elderly patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. In the control arm, patients will receive radiotherapy, in the experimental arm, patients will receive bevacizumab during and after radiotherapy until progression.\n\nBackground:\n\nFor decades, neurosurgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy have been the cornerstones of treatment for patients with glioblastoma. Most chemotherapeutic agents showed little or no activity in malignant glioma patients, with the possible exception of nitrosoureas. This has changed with the introduction of temozolomide, first shown to be active in recurrent disease (Yung et al. 2000) and more recently in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (Stupp et al. 2005, 2009). This EORTC 26981-22981 NCIC CE.3 trial demonstrated an increase in median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months and of the 2 year survival rate from 10% to 26% in patients receiving radiotherapy plus temozolomide compared with radiotherapy alone. Notably patients with tumors exhibiting methylation of the promoter region of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene showed a striking benefit from temozolomide (Hegi et al. 2005). Yet, inclusion in this trial was limited to patients up to the age of 70, and subgroup analyses demonstrated that younger patients were more likely to derive benefit from combined modality treatment than older patients. Thus, radiotherapy alone is still the standard of care in the elderly. The value of radiotherapy has been confirmed in a small randomized trial comparing best supportive care versus radiotherapy alone: median survival was 29 weeks with radiotherapy compared with 16.9 weeks with supportive care only (Keime-Guibert et al. 2007). Based on the overall shorter survival in elderly patients, hypofractionated radiotherapy has been explored and shown to be equieffective in patients aged 65-70 years and more (Roa et al. 2004). Two randomized trials presented in abstract form at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2010 failed to show superiority of primary temozolomide chemotherapy alone over radiotherapy alone in elderly patients (Malmstrom et al. 2010, Wick et al. 2010a). In fact, the German NOA-08 trial even showed that primary temozolomide alone is not non-inferior to primary radiotherapy alone (Wick et al. 2010a). A concomitant treatment strategy is currently evaluated in a NCIC-EORTC randomized trial. Further, the Nordic trial corroborated the equieffectiveness of an accelerated radiotherapy protocol of 40 Gy administered in 15 fractions versus the standard fractionation of 30 x 2 Gy. Altogether, these clinical data justify the exploration of new, temozolomide-free first-line treatment strategies in glioblastoma.\n\nGlioblastomas express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are highly vascularized tumors. The VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, has recently gained approval in patients with recurrent glioblastoma in the USA and in Switzerland in 2009, but not in the EU. Its role in the first-line treatment of glioblastoma is currently being evaluated in randomized trials. There is limited data on the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in elderly patients with glioblastoma, although the safety profile of bevacizumab in elderly patients with other types of cancer, e.g., lung cancer is favorable. There are ample rationales for combining bevacizumab with radiotherapy, including the induction of VEGF by radiotherapy and the concept of vascular normalization resulting in increased oxygenation and thus sensitivity to radiotherapy. Thus, bevacizumab is not only expected to inhibit angiogenesis, but may also exhibit additive or synergistic interactions with radiotherapy and further impair tumor growth. Altogether, this study seeks to explore, using a dedicated neuroimaging protocol, the possibility that bevacizumab enhances the effects of radiotherapy via the process of vascular normalization.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the elderly.",

The primary diagnostic test for tumors in the brain shows magnetic resonance imaging or similar imaging findings (especially single metastatic brain cancer) that make it difficult to distinguish between these two diseases. In addition, due to the specificity of the tissue called the brain, biopsy is not easy and sometimes biopsy is difficult, so non-invasive discrimination is often important, and it is important how much prediction is made before the biopsy. To solve this problem, various advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques have been studied, but they are all tests that need to be additionally conducted on ordinary magnetic resonance images, and there are many subjective factors, so complex data and statistical processing methods, and many cannot be easily tested. In addition, in all of these tests, accuracy is still reported at around 60%. Therefore, if contrast-enhanced FLAIR images can be obtained along with contrast-enhanced T1 images performed during conventional magnetic resonance imaging tests to help differentiate between two diseases, it will greatly help diagnose and treat brain tumor patients and facilitate clinical application.",
    "detailed_description": "Polyplastic glioblastoma and metastatic brain tumors are the most common brain tumors in adults. Polyplastic glioblastoma is the most common tumor among malignant primary brain tumors, and metastatic brain tumors are the most common brain tumors in adults. In the diagnosis of brain tumors, magnetic resonance imaging is the most basic and primary imaging technique to date. However, in the case of a single metastatic brain tumor, the tumor shape, signal intensity, contrast enhancement pattern, and peripheral signal intensity appear so similar that they are hardly distinguished from polymorphic glioblastoma in conventional magnetic resonance images. However, it is very important to distinguish between the two diseases because the above two diseases have completely different characteristics in clinical aspects, surgical method decisions, treatment decisions, and prognosis. Obtaining histological results will be the ultimate answer, but due to the nature of tissue called the brain, non-invasive tests are preferred, and sometimes patients (e.g., cardiovascular disease) or lesions themselves cannot handle surgery are in a very important part of the brain, so it depends on imaging techniques. In addition, the distinction between the two diseases through imaging is important in that it is important to predict in advance even if biopsy is performed through surgery. Therefore, various advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion-enhanced imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging (perfusion), and spectroscopic imaging (MR spectroscopy) have been attempted to better differentiate the two diseases through imaging tests. However, these images are additional imaging tests that need to be obtained after obtaining conventional magnetic resonance images and are usually accompanied by complex and various statistical analyses due to many subjective elements. In addition, there are tests that are difficult to conduct other than large hospitals with a certain size or larger. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the discrimination between the two diseases to date is around 60%. In addition, such tests are often difficult to perform in most hospitals, except for large hospitals with a certain size or larger. Therefore, if the two diseases can be better identified in conventional magnetic resonance imaging, it will be of great help to patient care clinically and it is expected that actual clinical application will be easier. Contrast-enhanced T1 highlighted images are always performed in conventional magnetic resonance images, and after that, one more FLAIR image is obtained to see if contrast-enhanced FLAIR images are helpful in differentiating the two diseases.",

    "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II study will assess the impact of pre-conditioning on migration and survival among newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients who have undergone definitive resection and completed standard temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation treatment, as well as the impact of tetanus pre-conditioning and basiliximab together on survival. After completing standard of care radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ, patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: 1). receive cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific dendritic cell (DC) vaccines with unpulsed (not loaded) DC pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine; 2). receive CMV-specific DC vaccines with Tetanus-Diphtheria Toxoid (Td) pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine; 3). receive basiliximab infusions prior to the 1st and 2nd DC vaccines along with Td pre-conditioning prior to the 4th vaccine. A permuted block randomization algorithm using a 1:1:1 allocation ratio will be used to assign patients to a treatment arm. Randomization will be stratified by CMV status (positive, negative), with the assignment to arms I and II being double-blinded. Effective March 2017, randomization to Group III has been terminated.",
    "detailed_description": "A maximum of 100 patients with resected, newly-diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV GBM will be enrolled in this study with the expectation that approximately 79 patients will be randomized to subsequent treatment after completion of radiation treatment with concurrent temozolomide. Effective March 2017, randomization to Group III has been terminated. All consented patients will undergo a leukapheresis after resection for harvest of Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBLs) for generation of DCs. Patients will then receive Radiation Therapy (RT) and concurrent TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m\\^2/d. Patients should start RT within approximately 6 weeks of surgery. Patients who experience progressive disease during radiation, are dependent on steroid supplements above physiologic levels at time of first vaccination, are unable to tolerate TMZ, or whose DCs or PBLs fail to meet release criteria will be withdrawn from the study and replaced and will not undergo repeat leukapheresis. For patients whose initial leukapheresis yields less than 3 vaccines, repeat leukapheresis may be obtained a minimum of 2 weeks from the previous leukapheresis (and may be repeated as needed) if pre-pheresis blood work is within the Apheresis Center's parameters and as long as this does not cause a significant delay in treatment for the patient.\n\nAfter RT and concurrent TMZ, patients will then be randomized and begin the initial cycle of TMZ at a standard targeted dose of 150-200mg/m\\^2/d for 5 days at the discretion of the treating oncologist 4 (\u00b1 2) weeks after completing RT. The study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of 150-200mg/m\\^2/d for 5 days every 5 (\u00b1 1) weeks. All patients will receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines given bilaterally at the groin site unless progression occurs. DC vaccines will be given intradermally (i.d.) and divided equally to both inguinal regions. DC vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying the initiation of TMZ cycle 2. Patients will then be vaccinated in conjunction with subsequent TMZ cycles every 5 (\u00b1 1) weeks for a total of 6 to 12 cycles after RT at the discretion of the treating oncologist. DCs will be given on day 21 \u00b1 2 days of each TMZ cycle. DC vaccinations will continue during TMZ cycles up to a total of 10 unless progression occurs.\n\nBefore the first DC vaccination, all patients will receive immunization with 0.5 mL of Td intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle to ensure adequate immunity to the tetanus antigen. Those assigned to Group III will receive basiliximab 20 mg infusions 1 week before the 1st and 1 week before the 2nd vaccine. At the time of the fourth DC vaccine, patients will receive pre-conditioning per the assigned group (Group I-unpulsed DCs i.d.; Group II- Td i.d.; Group III-Td i.d.). A single dose of Td toxoid (1 flocculation unit, in 0.3 milliliters (mLs) of saline for a total volume of 0.4 mLs) or 0.4 mLs of 1 x 10\\^6 autologous unpulsed DCs in saline will be administered to a single side of the groin, and 0.4 mLs of saline administered to the contralateral side 12-24 hours prior to the fourth DC vaccine, which is always given bilaterally at the groin site. Patients in Groups I and II will then receive 111In-labeled DCs to compare the effects of different skin preparations on DC migration followed by Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography and Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging immediately and at 1 and 2 days after injection. Group III will not undergo migration studies. Groups I and II will be double blinded. Group III will not be blinded.\n\nAll patients will undergo leukapheresis again for immunologic monitoring with specific assessment of baseline antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and further DC generations 4 (\u00b1 2) weeks after vaccine #3. Patients will be imaged bimonthly without receiving any other prescribed anti-tumor therapy. Patients will undergo an additional leukapheresis for generation of DCs if needed to continue vaccinations.\n\nAs part of standard care for these patients, upon tumor progression, participants may undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection. As this is not a research procedure consent will be obtained separately. However, if tissue is obtained, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically and to assess immunologic cell infiltration and pp65 antigen escape at the tumor site.",

    "detailed_description": "Background\n\nBevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular- endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the major angiogenesis factor involved in high-grade glioma-mediated angiogenesis. Preclinical studies in our laboratory and others have shown potent antiglioma activity in vivo and early clinical trials of bevacizumab in combination with irinotecan and alone (National Institutes of Health (NIH) study) have demonstrated significant anti-vascular permeability and anti-glioma effects in patients with recurrent gliomas.\n\nTandutinib (MLN518) along with bevacizumab represents an attempt to further capitalize on the concept of targeting the tumor vasculature. Tandutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and cKIT (type III receptor tyrosine kinases). It has demonstrated anti-leukemic activity in patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whose blasts contain an activating internal tandem duplication mutation of FLT3. However, in this study tandutinib is being added to bevacizumab primarily for its activity against the PDGFR and cKIT. Hannahan and colleagues have demonstrated the additional anti-tumor activity that results in vivo with combined inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and PDGFR. The activity of PDGFR inhibition is hypothesized to result from its effect on pericytes, the cells that surround and support endothelial cells. These cells have abundant expression of PDGFR and require platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-PDGFR interaction for their normal function.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of the combination of bevacizumab and tandutinib in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas, as determined by progression-free-survival.\n\nEligibility\n\nPatients with histologically proven recurrent malignant glioma are eligible for this study.\n\nDesign\n\nPatients will receive tandutinib as a single agent at a daily dose of 500 mg PO bid for the first 14 days of treatment. Radiology: Prior to the first dose of tandutinib patients will undergo an MRI-perfusion scan and an FDG-PET scan. An MRI-perfusion scan will then be repeated between days 12-14 of the first 14 days of tandutinib monotherapy. On day 15, treatment with bevacizumab will be added to the ongoing treatment with tandutinib. Bevacizumab will be given intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg, repeated once every 2 weeks. After completion of the first 4 weeks of combined tandutinib and bevacizumab therapy (6 weeks after initiating treatment with tandutinib) considered the first cycle of therapy) the MRI-perfusion and fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans will be repeated before the next dose of bevacizumab is given. Patients who are clinically/neurologically stable, and who have radiographically stable or responding disease at the end of that first cycle and every cycle thereafter (every 4 weeks), will continue treatment with tandutinib and bevacizumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion scans will be repeated after the completion of every 4 weeks of therapy. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled to this study (GBM (glioblastoma multiforme)=40, AG=40)",

    "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also block the growth of the tumor by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether bevacizumab together with dasatinib are more effective than a placebo in treating patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma or glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial (Phase I completed) is studying the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when given together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma or glioblastoma multiforme.",
    "detailed_description": "OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study (Phase I completed) of dasatinib followed by a phase II randomized study.

To assess the safety and adverse events of the dasatinib in combination with bevacizumab in this patient population. (Phase I)\n3. To estimate the efficacy of the bevacizumab combination with dasatinib in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme as measured by progression free survival at six months and compare it with the efficacy of bevacizumab alone. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. To describe the overall toxicity associated with the dasatinib/bevacizumab combination. (Phase I)\n2. To describe any preliminary evidence of antitumor activity. (Phase I)\n3. To assess the time to disease progression. (Phase II)\n4.

    "brief_summary": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Despite surgery and radiochemotherapy, the tumors are likely to grow back very quickly.\n\nIntraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) may improve local control rates while sparing healthy tissue (Giordano et al. 2014). IORT takes place before cranioplasty directly after gross (or subtotal) tumor resection. Several past studies on IORT for GBM conducted in Japan and Spain have yielded encouraging results (Sakai et al. 1989; Matsutani et al. 1994; Fujiwara et al. 1995; Ortiz de Urbina et al. 1995).\n\nHowever, the full potential of the procedure is to date largely unexplored as most previous studies used forward-scattering (electron-based) irradiation techniques, which frequently led to inadequately covered target volumes. With the advent of the spherically irradiation devices such as the Intrabeam\u00ae system (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Oberkochen, Germany), even complex cavities can be adequately covered with irradiation during IORT. However, there is no data on the maximum tolerated dose of IORT with low-energy X-rays as generated by this system.\n\nThe INTRAGO I/II study aims to find out which dose of a single shot of radiation, delivered intraoperatively direct after surgery, is tolerable for patients with GBM. A secondary goal of the study is to find out whether the procedure may improve survival rates.",

    "brief_summary": "Background:\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with gliomas that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the patient's white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) vIII incorporated in the retrovirus.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-EGFRvIII cells) are a safe and effective treatment for advanced gliomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-70 with malignant glioma expressing the EGFRvIII molecule.\n\nDesign:\n\nWork up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed\n\nLeukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-EGFRvIII cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}\n\nTreatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-EGFRvIII cells, and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n\nFollow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans every month for the first year, and then every 1-2 months as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.",

The intent therefore is that patients had no more than 2 prior therapies (initial and treatment for 1 relapse). If the participant had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor therapy was instituted for up to 12 weeks, and the participant undergoes another surgical resection, this is considered as a second relapse.

Furthermore, for this same reason, fluctuation in corticosteroid dose around this MRI does not warrant repeat scan so long as there is documented unequivocal evidence of tumor progression available.\n* For Cohort 2, Immunohistochemical or genetic analysis on tumor tissue from a prior surgery must demonstrate activation of the PI3K pathway through one of the following: PIK3CA mutation of PIK3R1 mutation, PTEN negativity (\\<10% of tumor cells staining) oh immunohistochemistry, PTEN mutation (any), homozygous deletion of PTEN\n* Participants must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.\n* Participants must have recovered to a grade 0 or 1 from the toxic effects of prior therapy (with the exception of lymphopenia which is common after therapy with temozolomide).\n* From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have elapsed: 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter)from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies, or 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.\n* Participants with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive disease based upon nuclear imaging, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging or histopathology.\n* Participants having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible for Cohort 2 as long as the following conditions apply: a) They have recovered from the effects of surgery; b) Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for eligibility. To best assess the extent of residual disease postoperatively, an MRI or CT scan should ideally been performed no later than 96 hours following surgery or at least 28-days postoperatively, but scans performed outside of this window are considered acceptable if no alternative is available.

    "brief_summary": "The investigators' aim with the BRITER study is to produce a way of predicting who might be more or less likely to suffer side effects from radiotherapy prior to starting treatment for a glioblastoma (GBM), a type of brain tumour.\n\nGBM is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or best supportive care. The focus should be on maintaining a good quality of life for as long as possible.\n\nRadiotherapy to the brain is an effective treatment, however it can produce side effects. The degree of side effects different patients experience can vary widely. It has been thought that if the patient's underlying normal brain is fragile due to an underlying mild dementia or problems associated with high blood pressure or cholesterol then this might make them more vulnerable to radiotherapy.\n\nMRI scans can be used to assess whether there are changes in the normal brain. The BRITER study aims to use MRI scans to see whether the investigators can predict those patients who might be more at risk of side effects from radiotherapy. The trial is aimed at patients aged \\> 65 who have been newly diagnosed with a GBM and are going to receive radiotherapy. Patients who agree to take part in the trial will have had an MRI scan as part of their normal diagnosis. Participants will undertake some questionnaires before starting their radiotherapy which will aim to assess their quality of life and their mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning (called cognitive function). Participants may also need an extra MRI scan.\n\nParticipants will repeat these questionnaires 4 and 8 weeks after treatment when they come for their follow up appointments. The investigators will compare them to measurements made on the pre-treatment MRI scan.\n\nParticipation in the study does not change the treatment the patient receives.\n\nThe investigators hope that the BRITER study will enable them to predict the degree of side effects a patient is likely to experience before embarking on radiotherapy treatment. This will enable more informative, individualised discussions surrounding the best treatment path for older patients with a GBM.",
    "detailed_description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the commonest primary malignant brain tumour among the adult population with approximately 2,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK per year. Incidence peaks in the 7th and 8th decades of life and as the global population ages, rates are increasing. Outcomes from this disease remain poor with median life expectancy in the range of 12-18 months, dropping to 3-6 months in the older population. The reasons for this are multifactorial, including more aggressive tumour biology in the older age group, decreased tolerance to treatment related side effects and the potential of under treatment by doctors within the older age group.\n\nGiven the poor prognosis in this group, treatment must be balanced against side effects and worsening quality of life. In patients aged 65 or over there is a lack of consensus on standard of care. Radiotherapy has a survival advantage over best supportive care however the optimal dose of radiotherapy is yet to be established. A recent Phase III trial randomised elderly GBM patients to standard radiotherapy with 60Gy in 30#, hypofractionated radiotherapy of 34Gy in 10# or temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy alone. For patients older than 65, survival was significantly longer with TMZ or hypofractionated radiotherapy than with standard radiotherapy . Those with defects in the DNA repair protein MGMT did significantly better in the chemotherapy arm than those with intact MGMT, a result which was replicated in the NOA-08 trial which randomised elderly GBM patients to standard radiotherapy with 60Gy in 30# or TMZ alone. This non-inferiority trial showed TMZ to be a suitable monotherapy option, with greater effect seen in those with MGMT promoter methylation . Recently published evidence has shown a survival benefit from adding concomitant and adjuvant TMZ to a hypofractionated radiotherapy regime of 40Gy in 15# in patients aged over 65, again with greater effect seen in those with MGMT promoter methylation . There is therefore now evidence to support the use of concomitant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy or radiotherapy as single agents amongst elderly GBM patients and an increasing interest in using MGMT promoter methylation status as a biomarker. However there remains a paucity of data surrounding the clinical and radiological basis by which individual patients are assessed for treatment.\n\nThe majority of GBM patients over 65 who are actively treated by oncologists receive some form of radiotherapy to the brain. Short term side effects from radiotherapy include fatigue, headache, cognitive defects, nausea, weakness and a need for increased steroid doses. Longer term side effects include persistent cognitive defects, long term fatigue and hormonal imbalances . Radiation causes an inflammatory response within the brain tissue as well as disrupting the blood brain barrier. It affects the vasculature of the brain with endothelial cell damage leading to microvascular dilatation, thickening of the vessel wall and increased risk of microbleeds and ischemic strokes in the months to follow . There is a risk of inducing tissue necrosis from occlusion of small blood vessels within the brain parenchyma, leading to coagulation, focal necrosis and demyelination. Animal models have suggested radiation is cytotoxic to developing neuroglial progenitor cells with areas of stem cells such as the hippocampus and periventricular zones, particularly vulnerable to damage, leading to longer term neurocognitive decline . There is evidence to suggest that radiotherapy can stabilise or improve functional ability for some older patients with GBM as well as providing a survival advantage however clinical experience shows that the degree of side effects experienced and their impact on quality of life varies widely within this patient cohort.\n\nRisk factors for toxicities from radiotherapy include dose, fractionation and age however there are no more accurate ways of predicting which patients are more likely to suffer side effects. MRI has been shown to accurately pick up microhaemorrhages and other ischemic changes which may correlate with a 'vulnerable' brain pre-treatment . These MRI changes have been examined in Alzheimer and dementia research with correlations shown between MRI markers and disease severity , however they have not yet been used within the neuro oncology setting.\n\nThe investigators aim to examine the relationship between MRI markers of a 'vulnerable' brain and degree of acute side effects and change in quality of life amongst a population of older patients being treated with cranial radiotherapy for GBM.\n\nThe poor prognosis of older GBM patients leads to an emphasis on the need for focusing on quality of life when deciding on treatment regimes. There are pathological markers which can help them determine the sensitivity of the tumour to chemotherapy however there is no such guidance when it comes to making decisions about radiotherapy. If it were possible to predict the degree of side effects likely to be experienced by a patient from radiotherapy treatment then it would enable clinicians to make more individually tailored, patient centred treatment plans.\n\nThe investigators aim to see if analysis of pre-radiotherapy MRI scans including T2 gradient echo and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences can correlate with acute treatment related toxicity and quality of life amongst patients aged 65 or over undergoing partial brain radiotherapy for GBM. As these patients have an average life expectancy of 3-6 months within the UK the investigators are focussing on acute rather than long term side effects of radiotherapy.\n\nMRI sequences will be utilised to determine any markers of background subclinical microvascular or degenerative disease in the normal brain including microhaemorrhage secondary to hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy and atrophy with cortical volume measurement of the contralateral hemisphere. Additional susceptibility weighted sequences will be performed to identify the presence of microhaemorrhages in the contralateral normal-appearing brain parenchyma. These will be semi-quantitatively assessed using a modified established microhaemorrhage scoring methodology. Absolute measures of the contralateral normal-appearing hemisphere cortical volumes will be acquired using FSL freesurfer software and a volumetric T1 weighted acquisition. These techniques will give the investigators a number of quantitative scores that can then assessed for correlation with changes in quality of life and toxicity scoring systems.\n\nRadiotherapy is an effective palliative treatment for GBMs and has been shown in clinical trials to maintain or improve health related quality of life. However outside of a clinical trial population, usual clinical practice reveals some patients in whom the side effect profile from cranial radiotherapy is intolerable and has a significant detrimental effect on patients' quality of life for their remaining short lifespan. The BRITER study aims to examine whether analysis of pre-treatment MRI scans in this cohort could help to predict who is more vulnerable to these side effects and therefore reveal a group of patients in whom single agent chemotherapy or best supportive care would be better treatment options.\n\nThe BRITER study is being performed in patients aged 65 or over who have a new diagnosis of GBM. It tests the hypothesis that there is a relationship between 6 scores of a 'vulnerable' brain seen on pre-treatment MRI and a clinically significant change in patient quality of life, as defined by a 10 point change in the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire from baseline to 8 weeks post treatment.",

    "brief_summary": "Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults (3,000 new cases per year) and is characterized by a poor prognosis (median survival 12 months). Treatment is based mainly on surgical excision as complete as possible followed by an additional radiochemotherapy. The prognosis depends mainly on the quality of resection when it is macroscopically complete. Different techniques to support the surgical resection have been developed over the past 20 years. The reference technique is currently the intraoperative neuronavigation for guiding excision by matching the intraoperative tumor boundaries with those of the preoperative MRI. Its main drawback is the loss of precision during the resection related to changes in anatomical limits of the tumor.\n\nThe per-operative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is an innovative alternative technique to support the surgical resection. The 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a molecule absorbed by the patient before surgery is captured specifically by the tumor cells and transformed into a fluorochrome revealed intraoperatively by a light source length adapted wave with a set of lenses included in the microscope. Resection is thus guided by this fluorescence whose disappearance translates complete tumor resection.\n\nIts interest is twofold:\n\n* Increase the percentage of complete tumor resection.\n* Improve disease-free survival and overall survival. The objective of the study is to compare the FGS to the intraoperative neuronavigation for the resection of glioblastoma, on a medical and economical level through a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial.\n\nThe annual number of patients likely to benefit of this technique in France is estimated at 2200 new cases.",

    "brief_summary": "Standard treatment of glioblastomas (GBMs) consists of microsurgical resection followed by concomitant chemoradiation. The extent of resection is one of the most important prognostic factors with significant influence on the survival of patients. State of the art technique to achieve the most radical resection possible in conventional surgery is fluorescence-guidance with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA). If available, intraoperative MRI (iMRI)-guided tumor resection enables an intraoperative resection control and subsequent continuation of surgery if contrast enhancing tumor remnants are found. Therefore a more radical resection and longer survival of patients might be possible. To date no comparison of these two leading technologies for GBM-surgery is available to identify the best surgical therapy of this fatal disease and to justify significant healthcare-economic differences between both technologies.\n\nGoal of this study is to assess the value of iMRI guidance in the resection of GBMs in comparison to conventional 5-ALA microsurgery. Primary endpoint is the number of total resections (no residual contrast enhancement) in the postoperative MRI (T1+CM within 48 hours after surgery) in each group. Secondary endpoints are perioperative clinical data, progression free survival, patients' clinical condition and overall survival.\n\nThe study design was chosen to be a parallel-group approach to compare iMRI and 5-ALA centers (n=13) to exclude possible bias which might be found by randomizing patients within individual iMRI centers and to have surgeons with the most experience possible in use of each respective technology.",

    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nIn vivo experiments have documented the ability of vandetanib (ZD6474) to inhibit tumor growth in various preclinical tumor models. Given the pronounced neovasculature associated with malignant gliomas, and abundant published data demonstrating the dependence of glioma growth on the maintenance and proliferation of this neovasculature, vandetanib represents a potentially promising new therapeutic approach to these otherwise refractory tumors. Phase II data of vandetanib for recurrent glioblastomas conducted at the National Institutes of Health showed promising activity but responses were usually short-lasting.\n\nCarboplatin has shown activity as monotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas in adults and preclinical data generated at Dr. Fines' laboratory demonstrate additive anti-glioma activity with vandetanib. The safety profile of carboplatin and the preclinical and clinical data supports its use in combination with vandetanib in patients with malignant gliomas.\n\nVandetanib is also an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor and it has been demonstrated that the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and non-phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT) predict for a higher likelihood of response to the EGFR inhibitors Tarceva and Iressa.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo establish data regarding the anti-tumor activity of vandetanib in combination with carboplatin and single agent carboplatin and to collect information regarding the spectrum of toxicities.\n\nTo determine if the presence of the EGFRvIII mutant and/or the presence of an intact PTEN and non-phosphorylated AKT predict for a higher likelihood of response to vandetanib.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients with histologically proven malignant glioma are eligible for this study.\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two groups. Patients in group one will be treated with vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) and with carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve at steady-state \\[area under curve (AUC)\\], 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle (combination group). Patients in group two will receive carboplatin alone (AUC 6mg/mL x min) once every 4-week cycle. Patients who develop tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity on carboplatin alone (group 2) can then receive single agent vandetanib (300 mg daily for patients not on enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and 400 mg daily for patients on EIAEDs) in 4-week cycles (sequential group). A total of 128 evaluable patients will be analyzed. The total accrual ceiling will allow for 74 patients to be enrolled in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stratum and 74 patients in the anaplastic gliomas (AG) stratum (total 148) to factor in replacing those patients who come off treatment prior to cycle 1.",

Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ponatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ponatinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal illness that could affect oral absorption of study drugs.\n* Individuals with a history of a different malignancy, other than cervical cancer in situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, are ineligible, except if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years, and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy OR if the other primary malignancy is neither currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention.\n* Any condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise patient safety or interfere with the evaluation of the drug.\n* HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ponatinib. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

    "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n\\- AZD8055 is an experimental cancer treatment drug that works by inhibiting a protein called mTOR, which is known to promote tumor cell and blood vessel growth and to control tumor s energy and nutrient levels. AZD8055 is the first drug that inhibits both types of mTOR protein and is expected to be more effective than prior mTOR inhibitors. However, more research is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness in treating brain tumors known as gliomas that have not responded to standard treatments.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD8055 in individuals with gliomas that have not responded to standard treatments.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with gliomas that have not responded to standard chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.\n* Participants will be separated into two treatment groups: one group that will receive surgery to remove the glioma and one that will not have surgical treatment.\n* Participants in the nonsurgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for a 42-day cycle of treatment. Participants will keep a diary to record doses and keep track of any side effects.\n* Participants in the surgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for 7 days, and then will have tumor removal surgery. At least 3 weeks after surgery, participants will resume doses of AZD8055 and will continue to take the drug for as long as the tumor does not recur.\n* During treatment, participants will have regular visits to the clinical center, involving frequent blood and urine tests and other examinations to monitor the effects of treatment. Participants will have imaging studies to study the cancer's response to the treatment.\n* Participants will continue to have cycles of treatment for as long as the treatment continues to be effective and the side effects are not severe enough to stop participation in the study....",
    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A significant percentage of gliomas have increased activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, mostly due to loss of PTEN.\n* AZD8055 is a first in-class inhibitor of the kinase activity of mTOR, specifically inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Preclinical data generated in the Neuro-Oncology Branch Laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine demonstrated that AZD8055 has significant anti-glioma activity in vivo and in vitro.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous once daily AZD8055 in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).\n* To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous once daily AZD8055 dosing.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Patients with histologically proven glioma are eligible for this study. Patients should have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.\n\nDesign:\n\n* This study will accrue up to 24 evaluable patients (non-surgical arm). Cohorts of 3 or 6 patients will receive continuous AZD8055 once daily orally for 42 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 6 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD8055 can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.\n* A subset of patients in whom tumor re-resection is considered standard of care will receive 1-week treatment with AZD8055 and then undergo resection. Patients will be treated at the highest dose level shown to be safe at the time of enrollment. Once patients recover from surgery, they will restart treatment with AZD8055 and stay on treatment as long as there is no tumor progression or protocol-mandated removal criteria. Management of toxicity will be the same as non-surgical patients receiving their second and subsequent cycles of therapy as delineated in the protocol. Up to 12 patients will enter the surgical arm of this trial.\n* The accrual ceiling will be open to 42 patients to factor in replacing those who come off\n\ntreatment prior to cycle 1.\n\n-At the end of Cycle 1, patients in both treatment arms (surgical and non-surgical) may choose to continue to receive AZD8055 until disease progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy.",

    "brief_summary": "Hypoxia is recognized to be an independent predictor of clinical outcome in oncology. PET using \\[18F\\]-FMISO has been described to be useful for the non invasive assessment of hypoxia in cancer. The use of this radiotracer for brain tumours is very limited and there is no standard to acquire and quantify \\[18F\\]-FMISO uptake. So there is a need for a methodological evaluation of this PET tracer The purpose of this research is to define optimal parameters for acquisition and data exploitation to quantify \\[18F\\]-FMISO uptake and so predict clinical outcome in glioblastomas.\n\nLow sensitivity to radiation of glioblastoma is partly caused by hypoxia. Hypoxia in tumours is not predicted by tumour size. Detecting and monitoring tissue oxygenation are of great interest to modify therapeutic strategies, including local dose escalation for radiotherapy or select chemotherapeutic agents with better impact in glioblastomas.\n\nPET with appropriate radiotracers, especially \\[18F\\]-FMISO, enables non-invasive assessment of hypoxia. \\[18F\\]-FMISO only accumulates in viable hypoxic cells. So, it has been demonstrated that PET using 18F-FMISO is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. But there isn't any optimal acquisition protocol or standardized images quantification treatment. Thus, the interpretation of \\[18F\\]-FMISO PET images and the predictive value of \\[18F\\]-FMISO SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) remain unclear explaining the need of methodological approaches.",
    "detailed_description": "Hypoxia is one of the worst prognostic factors of clinical outcome in glioblastomas. Today, it is well admitted that hypoxia is heterogeneous, variable within different tumour types and varied spatially and temporally. Hypoxia induced proteomic and gene expression changes that lead to increase angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. So the hypoxic fraction in solid tumours reduces their sensitivity to conventional treatment modalities, modulating therapeutic response to ionizing radiation or certain chemotherapeutic agents. This is particularly important in glioblastomas. Hypoxic cells in solid tumours could influence local failure following radiotherapy and has been associated with malignant progression, loco regional spread and distant metastases and represents an increasing probability of recurrence.\n\nThus, the non-invasive determination and monitoring of the oxygenation status of tumours is of importance to classify patients' outcome and modify therapeutic strategies in those tumours. Actually the oxygenation status of individual tumours is not assessed routinely. Numerous different approaches have been used to identify hypoxia in tumours. Eppendorf oxygen probe measurements (pO2 histography) may be considered as a 'gold standard' for hypoxia in human malignancies. However, it is an invasive method being confined to superficial, well accessible tumours and requires many measures. PET using \\[18F\\]Fluoro-deoxyglucose (\\[18F\\]-FDG), allows non-invasive imaging of glucose metabolism and takes a growing place in cancer staging, but \\[18F\\]-FDG can't assess correctly the oxygenation status of tumours and is not suitable for brain tumor. PET with appropriate radiotracers enables non-invasive assessment of presence and distribution of hypoxia in tumours. Nitroimidazoles are a class of electron affinic molecules that were shown to accumulate in hypoxic cells in cultures and in vivo. \\[18F\\]-FMISO is the most frequently employed tracer; its intracellular retention is dependent on oxygen concentration. Consequently \\[18F\\]-FMISO has been used as a non-invasive technique for detection of hypoxia in human. Different authors have demonstrated that it is suitable to localize and quantify hypoxia. Thus, \\[18F\\]-FMISO PET has been studied to evaluate prognosis and predict treatment response. However, some investigators report an unclear correlation between Eppendorf measurements and standardized uptake values (SUV). This observation may be explained by the structural complexity of hypoxic tumour tissues. Nevertheless, there is a need of standardized procedures to acquire and quantify \\[18F\\]-FMISO uptake. Actually the use of this tracer is very limited in clinic and the academic studies have included small populations of patients and suffer of the heterogeneity of technical procedures.\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the optimal acquisition protocol and treatment parameters enable to describe \\[18F\\]-FMISO uptake in glioblastomas known to be hardly influenced by hypoxia. Then, validate \\[18F\\]-FMISO-PET as a prognostic maker of recurrence.\n\nWe will introduce a pretherapy \\[18F\\]-FMISO PET-CT in the treatment planning of patients suffering of different newly diagnosed glioblastoma and eligible to a radical treatment with curative intent, consisting of conformational radiotherapy and chemotherapy. \\[18F\\]-FMISO PET-CT results will not be take into account for the patient management. We will test different acquisition protocols and use a wild panel of quantification parameters issued from published studies and original ones developed by our team enable to describe \\[18F\\]-FMISO uptake. Patients will be followed clinically and para-clinically during one year after the end of the treatment according to the edited recommendations of each tumour type and grade to analyze outcome (failure is define as persistent disease in the primary site, progression of disease, locoregional relapse after complete response or distant metastasis). Thus we will be able to measure failure free survival and determine overall survival.",

This includes the relationship between the amount and location of residual tumor detected by fluorescence, PpIX concentration, and intra-operative frameless stereotaxy following maximal resection versus the amount and location of tumor imaged post-operatively via CT and/or MRI.\n\nOUTLINE: This study will enroll evaluable participants undergoing surgical resection of malignant, grade IV gliomas in both of two groups: those with , newly diagnosed GBM and those with recurrent GBM. Participants in each group (primary vs recurrent GBM) will be randomized to one of 2 levels of ALA dose (10 and20 mg/kg) to be given orally at 6 hours prior to anticipated midpoint of surgery.\n\nParticipants who have consented to this protocol will be randomly assigned to one of two ALA dose groups. Randomization will be stratified by whether the tumor is newly diagnosed (i.e. de novo) or recurrent. The data center will prepare sealed, opaque envelopes with the randomized assignment to ALA dose and administration time and notify the pharmacy of the trial site so that so that the correct ALA dose can be prepared.\n\n* Arm I: Newly diagnosed GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid(10mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.\n* Arm II: Newly diagnosed GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (20mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.\n* Arm III: Recurrent GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (10mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.\n* Arm IV: Recurrent GBM participants receive oral aminolevulinic acid (20mg/kg)at 6 hours before the midpoint of surgery.\n\nFor both participants with new and recurrent disease, biopsies will be taken at up to six sites identified by the surgeon: in the tumor center, tumor edge, area surrounding the tumor (if safe), areas seen to fluoresce intraoperatively and an area with MR enhancement outside the tumor region (if this can be accomplished safely). Prior to collecting these biopsies readings will be taken at the biopsied location with the PpIX point probe by the surgeon. For each of the 6 biopsies, they will be divided into 3 parts and distributed for further analysis as follows: one portion will be sent to the pathologist for assessment of tumor percentage, one portion will be evaluated by the Division of Biophysics at the University of Toronto for PpIX concentration and the other for assessment of fluorescence.",
