Briefly, the BWLT was modified to incorporate education and practical strategies requested by patients, including AF risk factor management, pathophysiology, medications, and disease course; exercising with AF; and coping with difficult emotions regarding AF. Weekly treatment goals focus on nutrition and moderate calorie reduction while emphasizing adherence to an individualized CR exercise prescription.

    "brief_summary": "One-in-four Canadians will be diagnosed with an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation (AF) in their lifetime. This is expected to double by 2050, owing to an aging population and increased age- and health behaviour-associated AF risk factors (e.g., poor cardiorespiratory fitness, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and obesity). AF is associated with an increased risk of severe health outcomes including stroke, heart failure, dementia, and death. Nearly three-quarters of people with AF also have obesity (excess body weight). According to research, people with obesity that lose approximately 10% of their body weight can experience relief from uncomfortable AF symptoms. Losing weight may even help people return to a normal heart rhythm.\n\nCardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a proven way to help people with heart disease live longer, healthier lives. So far, research has not shown whether CR helps improve the abnormal heart rhythms seen in AF. This may be because CR programs usually do not offer specific help with weight management. Therefore, adding behavioural weight-loss treatment (BWLT; group classes to change thoughts and behaviours to encourage weight loss) to CR programs may help people with AF and obesity experience relief from their symptoms.\n\nThis randomized controlled trial will assess whether the combination of an AF-specific 'small changes' BWLT and traditional CR results in a greater proportion of patients with AF and obesity achieving \u2265 10% body weight loss compared to patients who receive standard care (traditional CR alone). Traditional CR consists of participating in exercise sessions, supervised by health professionals, twice per week for 12 weeks. In addition to traditional CR, patients that are randomized to receive BWLT will attend 12 weekly online group therapy classes to learn strategies from psychology to help encourage weight loss. The investigators will collect data pertaining to weight, AF burden, physical activity, and disease-specific and generic patient-reported outcomes. This information will determine if taking CR+BWLT helps patients with weight loss and AF symptoms. Further, it will help efforts to provide effective treatment to patients with AF to help participants lose weight and reduce or eliminate AF symptoms.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: One-in-four Canadians will develop atrial fibrillation (AF), increasing risk of heart failure and stroke. Obesity (i.e., BMI \u226530 kg/m2) represents a strong, independent risk factor for increased incidence and severity of AF. Weight loss reduces AF symptom burden, and patients with obesity who lose \u226510% of their body weight may achieve AF regression/remission. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves AF risk factors including hypertension and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), yet the efficacy of CR for reducing AF symptom burden is not established. CR rarely includes targeted obesity management and, on average, has a negligible impact on BMI. Adding behavioural weight-loss treatment (BWLT) to traditional CR may therefore enhance weight loss and lead to improvements in AF prognosis, symptoms, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) in patients with AF and obesity.\n\nGiven the high prevalence of obesity among individuals with AF, and its detrimental effect on AF burden and outcomes, there is a critical need for interventions that can support weight-loss-promoting behaviours and can be integrated into routine clinical care for AF. CR programs are available in all major Canadian cities and have a proven track-record of achieving clinically-relevant improvements in important AF risk factors including hypertension, lipid profile, and exercise capacity. Therefore, CR represents an ideal setting to promote risk factor management for patients with AF. Yet, because traditional CR does not produce meaningful weight loss there is a clear gap in the ability of current CR programming to meet the needs of a growing population of individuals with AF and obesity. The addition of a novel BWLT component to CR is needed to bridge this gap and provide the appropriate treatment regimen of comprehensive risk factor management, exercise, and weight loss to achieve optimal AF outcomes.\n\nThe primary aim is to: Assess whether the combination of an AF-specific 'small changes' BWLT and traditional CR results in a greater proportion of patients with AF and obesity achieving \u2265 10% body weight loss compared to patients who receive standard care (traditional CR alone).\n\nThe secondary aims of the proposed study are to evaluate the impact of BWLT+CR on: 1) mean % weight loss of controls vs. intervention group; 2) AF burden; 3) self-reported AF symptom burden; 4) disease-specific and generic patient-reported outcome measures (e.g., AF- and health-related quality-of-life \\[HRQoL\\]; psychological distress); and 5) exercise volume measured in weekly steps.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nThe primary study hypothesis is that patients in the BWLT+CR group will be more likely to achieve \u226510% weight loss at 12 months post-randomization relative to the CR-only group.\n\nSecondary hypotheses are that: patients in the BWLT+CR group will experience greater improvements in AF burden, AF self-reported symptom burden, increased HRQoL, decreased psychological distress, and increased leisure-time exercise and CR exercise session attendance relative to the CR-only group.\n\nStudy design:\n\nDesign and Procedure. Patients will be assessed for eligibility at TotalCardiology Rehabilitation (TCR). Eligible patients who consent to participate will be enrolled into the CR program and randomized to either the BWLT+CR or CR-only group. Prior to randomization, patients will complete a questionnaire battery including socio-demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, income, education), self-reported weight and height to establish BMI, and validated questionnaires assessing AF symptom burden, AF-related quality-of-life, general HRQOL, and psychological distress at baseline (T1). Patients will be re-administered the test battery following the 12-week BWLT+CR program, or 12 weeks of the CR-only program (T2). (Note: T2 measures will be administered even if the patient is still completing their remaining CR exercise sessions. CR completion/adherence will be determined after patients have completed their 12-week exercise program). The test battery will be administered for a final time approximately 24 weeks post-randomization. Weight loss from baseline to 52-weeks will be calculated and converted to a percentage of initial body weight at baseline. Clinical variables (e.g., CRF from graded exercise tests; blood pressure, lipids) will be obtained by TCR chart review.\n\nRecruitment. Patients will be recruited in two ways: (1) directly from TotalCardiology Rehabilitation using referrals from Dr. Wilton and TCR clinic staff, and (2) from an existing database of patients who participated in the Part I qualitative study and Part II acceptability study that provided consent to be contacted about future studies. The recruitment period will be from October 2022 to April 2024. Equal numbers of men and women will be recruited. AF clinic patients who are both (a) eligible for the CR program and (b) eligible for the proposed study will be identified by Dr. Wilton and/or TCR clinic staff. Dr. Wilton/TCR clinic staff will inform patients who meet (a) and (b) criteria about the study and invite them to participate. Interested patients will receive a CR referral and their contact information will be provided to the research coordinator. The research coordinator (B. Valdarchi) will contact patients, provide additional information about the study, and obtain informed consent. The research coordinator will then send an email link to complete baseline questionnaires. Following the completion of the questionnaires, participants will be informed about the group they were randomized to, and scheduled for BWLT groups if needed. Concurrently, patients will be contacted by CR staff to schedule their orientation appointment, as per typical clinic procedures. This recruitment procedure will also apply to patients who previously participated in Part I and II (i.e the qualitative and acceptability studies, respectively). TCR patients who are currently enrolled in CR will also be recruited. A research team member will identify CR patients who have consented to be approached about research and who are eligible for inclusion by reviewing patient chart data. An RA will contact patients by telephone to review study procedures and obtain patients' informed consent.\n\nSample Size/Analysis. Analysis will be by intention to treat. Conservatively assuming a 5% success rate in the control group and a 30% success rate in the intervention group, 78 patients (39 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a difference using a two-sided independent test of proportions with a 5% significance level. The investigators estimate loss to follow-up and drop-outs of 20% and 10% respectively, therefore 120 patients will be recruited in total (60 per group). The primary analysis will compare the proportion in each group achieving \u226510% weight loss between baseline and 52 weeks post-randomization. A secondary per-protocol analysis will be performed including only participants who complete at least the initial 12-weeks of the BWLT. AF burden will be calculated as a % of total ECG tracings and compared between treatment and controls. Self-reported secondary outcomes will be evaluated using linear mixed modelling.",

With the high cost of treating diabetes, cost-effective approaches are needed to reduce the incidence of diabetes. One new strategy may be to change when people eat. Studies in rodents suggest that a form of intermittent fasting that limits eating to a short time period each day and involves fasting for the rest of the day (time-restricted eating; TRE) improves blood sugar control and cardiovascular health. Preliminary studies suggest that TRE also improves blood sugar, weight loss, and cardiovascular health in humans. This study will be the first full-scale, controlled feeding trial to determine whether TRE can improve 24-hour blood sugar control, 24-hour blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease risk factors even when food intake is matched to the control group. This clinical trial will also determine whether the benefits of TRE depend on the time of day that people eat.

    "brief_summary": "Obesity is a life-threatening disease, defined by excessive fat accumulation that increases the risk of other diseases such as cardiovascular events, hypertension, diabetes and cancer. Obesity is also a risk factor for nosocomial infections and is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, although anthropometric measurements are not routinely recorded during hospitalization and lack of a registry data does not allow performing retrospective studies.Obesity is closely related to chronodisruption, characterized by deregulation of physiological and behavioral central and peripheral circadian rhythms contributing to the obesity-related metabolic impairment. Eating and sleeping time schedules are relevant synchronizers of humans' biological clock. Several studies suggest a role of dietary interventions in rewiring the circadian rhythm, with Mediterranean diet (MD) regulating nutritional patterns. Moreover, considering its positive impact on sleep quality, melatonin intake was suggested as a potential regulator of circadian rhythms. The relation between chronodisruption, obesity and infections has not been investigated, and a first proof of concept (Pilot study) will aim at investigating it. Three cohorts of obese patients with different aetiology (essential obesity, obesity with type 2 diabetes, genetic forms of obesity) and a cohort of lipodystrophic patients will be enrolled in the study, which is designed as a two-phases protocol. During the first phase (0-12 weeks (w)) patients will be subjected to dietary intervention with hypocaloric MD; in a second phase (12-24w), melatonin 1mg/die before sleep will be added to the hypocaloric MD. The susceptibility to infections will be investigated through the evaluation of 1) the number of events - i.e. flu- or flulike syndromes, skin, respiratory, digestive, urinary infections-per patient of the 4 groups and the blood assays to detect the infection with Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella, Measles and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM; hepatitis C and hepatitis B core antibodies and Quantiferon TB Gold, 2) the clock genes rhythm and TLRs expression in patient immune cells at baseline, 12w and 24w.The mutual relationship between biomedical values, environmental and social conditions, and lifestyle habits will be evaluated by structured questionnaires. Validation of questionnaires to explore the susceptibility to infections is another delivery planned for the current study.",
    "detailed_description": "The current project aims at investigating 1) the susceptibility to infectious disease in obese patients, the role of tailored dietetic schemes of Mediterranean diet (MD), and melatonin supplementation on infective events; 2) association of the oral and/or gut microbiota signature with bacterial or viral infections in the above described obese cohorts; 3) the mutual relationship between biomedical values, environmental conditions and lifestyle habits through structured questionnaires and therefore the possible impact of this study on the National Health System (NHS).\n\nThe role of melatonin as chronobiologic influencer of circadian metabolic processes and as anti-obesogenic and weight-reducing effector comes to the fore in these last decades. Moreover, melatonin is also known to possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may ameliorate the condition of low-grade chronic inflammation (metaflammation) observed in patients with obesity. Nevertheless, although there has been a tremendous interest in the role of the clock genes in regulating metabolic processes, relatively less effort has been expended examining how the regulation of circadian rhythms and metabolic inputs can affect the susceptibility to infections. To address this question, Unit 1 will enroll patients with essential obesity (20 subjects, BMI :30-35 Kg/m2) and with genetic forms of obesity (20 subjects) of both genders, aged 18-65yrs, to the main proof of concept pilot study.\n\nAt baseline (T0), patients will be subjected to anthropometric determinations, including body weight and height for BMI calculation, body composition by mean of DXA Scan, blood, serum and urine collection, oral cavity swab and stool sampling. Patients will undergo a session of behavioural dietary counselling by which patients will be educated to adhere to a hypocaloric MD for the first 12w (T1) and to add to the MD the supplementation with 1mg/die of melatonin for other 12w (T2). The same patients will be visited and subjected to the anthropometric determinations and biological samples at T0, T1, T2 of protocol. The endpoints for Unit 1 will be: 1.to investigate the impact of tailored hypocaloric MD and hypocaloric MD plus melatonin (supplement formulation, 1mg/die before sleep) on the number of events - i.e. flu- or flulike syndromes, skin, respiratory, digestive, urinary infections - per patient of the 4 groups, recording the number of infectious events during the clinical examinations in six months and 1 year follow up and detect the SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella and Measles IgG and IgM, hepatitis C and hepatitis B core antibodies and Quantiferon TB Gold (QFT-GIT). The obtained clinical results on infections events from the SIDERALE study will be used to formulate hypotheses for a prospective study and for the formulation of a specific validate questionnaire.\n\n2.to assess the impact of a tailored hypocaloric MD and hypocaloric MD plus melatonin (supplement formulation, 1mg/die before sleep) on anthropometric determinations, glucose and lipid metabolism, thyroid and adrenal axis, leptin, adiponectin, IGFBP2, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), ESR, high-sensitivity CRP, fibrinogen and inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-1Beta, IL-18) and melatonin that will be evaluated at T0, T1, T2.\n\n3.to assess the impact of a tailored hypocaloric MD and hypocaloric MD plus melatonin (supplement formulation, 1mg/die before sleep) on the entrainment of circadian clock misalignment, evaluating clock gene expression by RT-qPCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and concomitantly, on the regulation of Toll like-receptors (TLRs) and suppressor cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), known to play a crucial role in eliciting immunity and improving the well-known susceptibility to infections in patients with obesity, all evaluated by RT-qPCR in PBMC of all patients cohorts at 8 am, 12 pm and 12 am.\n\n4.to quantify the impact of our intervention on the NHS in terms of decrease of antibiotic and antiviral treatment and ER (emergency room) admissions in six months and 1 year of follow up.\n\nMoreover, an in vitro analysis will be performed on 3T3-L1 cells (mouse pre-adipocytes). 3T3-L1 differentiated in adipocytes will be synchronized and treated with melatonin in presence of TLRs agonists (i.e.\n\nlipopolysaccharide, Pam3CSK, ssRNA40, imiquimod). Evaluation of TLRs signalling pathway will be performed by western blot. Evaluation of inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, IL-1, IL-18) and chemokines (MCP-1, CXCL5) will be performed by CLIA and/or ELISA and/or western blot.",

The first and primary aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting a full-scale SMART to compare weight-focused (i.e., weight loss) and weight-neutral (i.e., weight loss is not an explicit goal) adaptive biobehavioral interventions for improving cardiometabolic health in Black adults with overweight or obesity (BMI \u226527 kg/m2) plus at least one weight-related cardiometabolic condition (high blood pressure, prediabetes or diabetes, and/or high cholesterol). Biobehavioral interventions are treatment strategies that combine lifestyle-based behavioral interventions such as eating a healthy diet and exercise with medications. In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either weight-focused or weight-neutral health coaching for 7 weeks. At week 8, participants will be identified as either \"responders\" or \"nonresponders\" to the initial interventions. The threshold for response in the weight-focused condition is greater than or equal to 3% weight loss. The threshold for response in the weight-neutral condition is engaging in greater than or equal to 150 minutes of moderate physical activity for the 7 days prior to the week 8 study visit. Responders to the initial interventions will continue with health coaching on a biweekly basis for weeks 9-26 of the intervention. Nonresponders will be re-randomized to either intensify the lifestyle-based intervention by receiving a membership to the YMCA and enrolling in group fitness classes or augmenting the health coaching with enhanced medical management in partnership with their established primary care provider. The second aim is to use clinical data from the pilot SMART to estimate treatment effects and the between-person variability in these effects. Because this is a pilot study, these estimates will not be used to make comparisons or draw conclusions on the comparative effectiveness of intervention conditions. Rather, these data will be used to generate preliminary effect sizes that can be used to estimate the sample size required for a full-scale trial. Clinical trial feasibility data will be collected on an ongoing basis throughout the study and clinical data will be collected prior to initiating the intervention (baseline) and at week 8 (response visit) and week 26 (post-intervention visit).",

    "detailed_description": "Type I diabetes is caused by an autoimmune destruction of insulin producing \u03b2-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency. In the first months after diagnosis, a small number of \u03b2-cells typically remain and, by producing insulin, significantly improve diabetes control and reduce disease burden.\n\nPreliminary data suggest that this early disease stage entitled the \"honeymoon period\" might be extended by a ketogenic diet, which would provide a major therapeutic advantage and may reduce chronic disease burden.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that a ketogenic vs. standard diet will extend the honeymoon period and improve diabetes control in children, the researchers are conducting a study employing education and food deliveries of a ketogenic or standard diet to children and their families. Fifty-two children aged 5 to 12 years with newly diagnosed diabetes will participate. Children will be assigned by chance (randomized) to receive either a ketogenic or a standard diet for 9 months. Chances to be assigned to either diet are 50:50 like a coin flip, and 26 children will participate in each diet arm.\n\nParticipants will receive a combination of free meals, groceries, micronutrient supplements, and intensive diet and diabetes education throughout the 9 months.

Bi-weekly data downloads and remote check-ins will be performed to assess dietary intake, satisfaction with diet and study procedures, and possible safety concerns. Participants are instructed to measure blood ketone levels with their home ketone meter anytime blood glucose levels exceed a safety threshold and to call the study physician for persistent low glucose levels or ketones above diet specific safety thresholds.\n\nStudy visits are held at at baseline, 1, 5, and 9 months to collect height, weight, stool and blood samples for hormones, metabolites and inflammatory biomarkers. At each visit, an intravenous catheter (IV) will be placed to collect fasting blood samples, followed by a liquid test meal (protein shake) and collection of four additional blood samples from the IV over the course of two hours.

Due to its widespread distribution in the environment and Lipophilicity, POPs can bioaccumulate along the food chain and eventually accumulate in the human body. There are many types of POPs, including dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) , polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) . POPs is ubiquitous and Lipophilic in the environment, so the potential harm of POPs to human body has aroused wide concern. A growing number of studies have found that exposure to POPs may be associated with an increased risk of endocrine disease, particularly type 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer.\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the effect of Persistent organic pollutant exposure on the development ofType 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer by analyzing serum Persistent organic pollutant concentrations in controls, and patients with Type 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer.",

There are limited published data of SGLT2i treatment of selected KTRs.\n\nObjective: The goal of this submission is to examine the safety and efficacy of SGLT2i therapy in Veterans with KTRs with and without T2DM. The hypothesis is treatment with SGLT2i will lead to improvements in graft and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, with acceptable side effect profile.\n\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, the investigators will execute a multicenter clinical trial at 5 VA medical centers, including 4 that serve as primary kidney transplant programs. The multidisciplinary research team includes transplant medical and surgical expertise, diabetology, and informatics and statistical support familiar with VA data systems. In open label fashion, the investigators will treat eligible KTRs and comprehensively assess adverse and serious adverse event data, as well as assess any untoward impacts on graft function and diabetes management. Secondly, the investigators will utilize VA data from the VINCI corporate data warehouse to develop a control cohort of Veterans with KTRs with and without T2DM, not treated with SGLT2i. The investigators will utilize propensity score matching to reduce bias that may occur in observational studies. With this strategy, the investigators will further address the potential beneficial impact of SGLT2i treatment on cardiovascular outcomes, as well as kidney disease progression in the transplanted kidney. The investigators will also analyze the cost impact of using this agent in this patient population, in terms of hospitalizations, unanticipated procedures, and CKD management.\n\nFindings: These studies will provide new information to the transplant community for both Veteran and non-Veteran alike, with a detailed assessment of safety and feasibility of this agent class using a pragmatic approach to transplant care. These results will translate into an opportunity to mitigate late graft loss in this patient population, and a potential breakthrough in clinical care that to date has been unrecognized.",

    "brief_summary": "The Cell Pouch\u2122 is a novel implantable device, that is transplanted with therapeutic cells such as insulin producing islets. This combination product is designed for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes. Upon implantation, the Cell Pouch is designed to form a natural environment, rich in tissue and microvessels for the transplant and function of therapeutic cells. The Cell Pouch is designed as a scaffold made of non-degradable polymers, formed into small cylindrical chambers which, when implanted against the abdominal muscle, becomes incorporated with vascularized tissue to the circumference of removable plugs within as early as two weeks as demonstrated in preclinical studies. After the tissue incorporation, the plugs are removed, leaving fully formed tissue chambers with central void spaces for the transplantation of therapeutic cells including Islets of Langerhans (islets). Tissue integration within and around the Cell Pouch forms a natural environment, rich in microvessels that allows the transplanted islets to engraft, resulting in a functional biohybrid organ. It is believed this engraftment will enable long-term survival and function of transplanted islets. This study aims to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of islet transplantation into the Cell Pouch for the treatment of T1D in subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes. The study also aims to establish islet release criteria that accurately characterize the islet product and are predictive of clinical transplant outcomes into the Cell Pouch, which will be demonstrated through defined efficacy measures.",
    "detailed_description": "The Sernova Cell Pouch is implanted against the abdominal musculature. A minimum of three weeks after Cell Pouch implantation, immunosuppression is initiated and optimized for another 3 weeks. This allows for vascularization of the Cell Pouch chambers and for the patient to be stabilized on immunosuppression prior to islet transplantation. A mass of highly purified islets will be transplanted in the Cell Pouch. The Cell Pouch will be assessed for safety and tolerability for up to five years (recently increased from 3 years) following the last transplant to Cell Pouch. Data for the primary and secondary endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics (such as counts and percentages).",

    "brief_summary": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), which can significantly increase all-cause mortality and the incidence of serious cardiovascular events, and increase the burden of the national economy. The epidemiological characteristics and the clinical progress of CAC are still not clear. Moreover, the pathogenesis of CAC has not yet been fully elucidated, and lack of specific diagnostic indicators. Arterial calcification is an active, reversible, and multifactorial biological process like bone formation. It is generally believed that early detection of calcification lesions and active targeted treatment may be the key to prevention and treatment of vascular calcification. In addition, statins are commonly used in patients with dyslipidemia and can stabilize CAC plaque. However, the timing, dosage and effect of statins are controversial. Moreover, our previous study found that the expression of miR-32 is significantly elevated in patients with CAC, and can promoting vascular calcification. Herein, this study is to conduct a prospective cohort study on T2DM patients with CAC in Hunan province through a multidisciplinary and multi-center cooperation model, the main research objectives include the following three parts: \u2460 To identify the prevalence, incidence, and characteristics of CAC in T2DM patients in Hunan province, and to build a risk assessment model. \u2461 To observe the effects of statins on the occurrence and development of CAC in patients with T2DM, and to provide clinical data for the improvement of medication guidelines; \u2462To observe the dynamic changes of serum miR-32 in the progression of CAC in patients with T2DM, and to explore its possibility as a serological diagnosis or prognostic bio-maker of CAC. The completion of this research project is expected to bring a new breakthrough in the field of early diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and intervention treatment of patients with T2DM combined with CAC, and provide an important reference for the formulation of cardiovascular disease prevention and control strategy.",
    "detailed_description": "The prospective cohort study of type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) with coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a multi-center, observational clinical study. The study included a baseline survey and 8-year follow-up survey of hospitalized patients with T2DM in seven third-class hospital in Hunan Province (the follow-up is divided into two stages, the first stage is the first 4 years, and the second stage is the last 4 years). The first phase is conducted in three affiliated hospitals of University of South China in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, and the second phase is conducted in four representative Grade-A hospitals according to the geographical location of Hunan Province. The sample size of each center is set to be at least 200 cases, and that of a single center is at most 500 cases. The diagnosis of T2DM is made according to the criteria of the WHO in 1999, and the hyperglycemia caused by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, special type diabetes and other factors are excluded. The volume and density of coronary artery calcification are evaluated by low dose prospectively triggered sequential dual-source CT coronary angiography. The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is calculated by CAS coring software. MiR-32 is detected by PCR. All in all, this clinical trial is aiming to establishing a prospective long-term follow-up cohort of patients with T2DM complicated with CAC in Hunan Province, to observing the effect of statins on the occurrence and development of CAC in patients with T2DM, and to exploring the dynamic changes of serum miR-32 in this process to determine whether it can be used as an early diagnosis and prognostic marker of vascular calcification.",

If study participants do not reach the weight loss goal at 3 months, they are recommended two additional months of total diet replacement. If weight regain occurs during the weight maintenance phase, a rescue plan with total diet replacement will be recommended. To increase the chances to maintain their lower body weight, participants will use a program specifically design for that purpose based on cognitive behavioural therapy. Total study duration is two years.\n\nThe one hundred and six participants are randomised to either the eHealth follow-up or the face-to-face follow-up. The dietary advice to achieve and maintain weight loss is the same in both groups and delivered by the same dietician, physician, and nurse but the method of follow-up differs between groups (eHealth vs face-to-face).\n\neHealth group:\n\nAll study information and the cognitive behavioural therapy program is given by an eHealth application in St\u00f6d och behandling which is part of 1177.se.

    "brief_summary": "Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a serious and progressive disease. Guidelines recommend surgical valve repair of severe TR in symptomatic patients. Despite its association with excess mortality and morbidity, TR has been relatively neglected and is severely undertreated. In particular this is because isolated tricuspid surgery remains associated with high mortality rates, and thus, patients with severe TR are often deemed inoperable due to severe co-morbidities and frailty. In recent years, percutaneous CE-mark approved techniques for transcatheter tricuspid valve treatment (TTVT) have emerged as alternatives to surgery. These include (I) transcatheter annuloplasty devices (Tricuspid Cardioband) and (II) transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TriClip, PASCAL). Several non-randomized studies suggested improved functional outcomes after TTVT, however, to data there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials addressing the actual efficacy of TTVT. The TRICuspid Intervention in Heart Failure trial (TRICI-HF trial) will assess the concept that TTVT will translate into a reduced morbidity and mortality. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to TTVT plus OMT (Experimental group) or OMT alone (Control group). TRICI-HF is an industry-independent, investigator-initiated strategy study and investigators may choose any suitable CE-marked percutaneous system \"on-label\" for TTVT.",

When performing TRE, individuals consume all of their calories within a specific time window and then only consume water or other no calorie drinks the rest of the day. TRE is performed each day. There is no restriction on the quality or amount of food that people can consume during their eating window (ad libitum eating) with TRE, which can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours. We are comparing three different 9-hour eating windows to determine whether the start and stop time of the eating window impact blood sugar control in individuals with obesity who also have or are at risk for type 2 diabetes. We also aim to determine if there are differences in the effects of the timing of eating window between males and females.",
    "detailed_description": "The overarching aim of this study is to evaluate the interactions between TRE window timing, type 2 diabetes status, and sex among individuals with obesity. The first objective is to compare the effects of three 9-h TRE window times (early: 7:00-16:00 h, mid: 9:30-18:30 h, delayed: 12:00-21:00 h) on real-time, free-living glycemic control. The second objective is to determine if type 2 diabetes status (type 2 diabetes versus prediabetes or moderate+ risk for type 2 diabetes aka at risk for type 2 diabetes) modifies the effect of eating window timing on glycemic control outcomes. The exploratory objectives include: 1) determine whether sex modifies TRE adherence or the effect of TRE on metabolic changes relative to control; and 2) to compare changes in dietary intake, body weight, and blood pressure within and between early, mid, and delayed TRE. We have the following hypotheses related to these objectives:\n\n1. The early TRE window will result in the most favourable glycemic control outcomes but also the lowest participant acceptability followed by mid and delayed TRE.\n2. There will be larger differences in glycemic control outcomes between the TRE window timings among those with type 2 diabetes compared to those at risk for type 2 diabetes.\n3. TRE adherence and changes in glycemic control, and weight loss with all TRE window times (relative to control) will be higher in men vs women.\n4. Energy, carbohydrate, and sugar intake, body weight, and blood pressure will decrease during TRE, but with no differences by window timing.",

    "brief_summary": "This study aims to explore how food insecurity, a lack of consistent access to enough food, may lead to changes in the body that make it harder to lose weight. The investigators are testing whether providing women experiencing food insecurity with a stable, healthy, and personalized meal plan can improve their metabolism and reduce their motivation to eat unhealthy foods. The hypothesis is that addressing food insecurity with a predictable diet can lower a person's respiratory quotient (a measure of how the body uses energy), promote fat burning, and improve overall health. This research will improve the understanding for how food insecurity contributes to obesity and may lead to better solutions for managing weight in individuals facing these challenges.",
    "detailed_description": "Women who experience food insecurity have unpredictable access to food and often miss meals and go hungry, but paradoxically are at a 50% greater risk for developing obesity than women who are food secure. This is due in part to metabolic and behavioral factors involved in food insecurity. Research suggests unpredictable access to food is associated with: 1) a high respiratory quotient (RQ) indicative of substrate oxidation that favors storage of fat and burning of carbohydrates; 2) an increase in fuel efficiency and a reduced thermic effect of food (TEF); 3) higher relative reinforcing efficacy of food (RREFOOD), due in part to periodic food deprivation that results from unpredictable access to food and being hungry, and 4) a short temporal window that involves making decisions that focus on meeting immediate versus long-term goals, as assessed by delay discounting (DD). While people with food insecurity and obesity should modify their diet, an RQ that favors storage of fat coupled with a reduced TEF, high RREFOOD and high DD may compromise the effects of traditional dietary approaches to weight loss. The goal of this pilot study is to examine the effects of providing a personalized, stable, predictable, low carbohydrate, low glycemic index, high protein, low energy dense diet on changes in metabolic and behavioral factors that characterize low-income women with food insecurity who have obesity, using a novel stepped wedge design. This work extends our research on behavioral and metabolic factors involved in food insecurity, and will provide strong pilot data for a randomized, controlled trial of a novel dietary approach that target factors involved in food insecurity and obesity that can improve weight control and reduce cardiometabolic risk factors. The investigators expect to screen at least 60 women, with an estimated screen failure rate of 80%. A goal for this pilot project is to provide effect sizes for future studies. The sample size was determined based on feasibility constraints, with the understanding that these results will serve as pilot data for a larger, fully powered randomized controlled trial.",

DPN is a common complication of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus that significantly impairs quality of life through chronic pain, balance deficits, and decreased functional mobility. While pharmacological treatments are commonly used, they often result in adverse side effects, creating a growing need for non-pharmacological interventions like therapeutic exercises.\n\nTai Chi, a traditional Chinese exercise combining slow movements and mental focus, has shown benefits in improving mobility and reducing fall risks in chronic disease populations. The Modified-Otago program, originally developed to prevent falls in the elderly, emphasizes strength and balance training through structured exercise routines.\n\nA total of 36 participants (aged 40-80 years) with at least a 5-year history of Type 2 diabetes and a minimum pain score of \u22653 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) will be recruited. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the Tai Chi group or the Modified-Otago group. Both groups will receive 24 sessions over an 8-week period (3 sessions per week), along with baseline interventions such as heating pad application, TENS, and warm-up/cool-down routines.\n\nPrimary outcome measures include NPRS for pain, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) for balance, and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) for motor function. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and two weeks post-treatment. Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 26 to determine within-group and between-group differences.\n\nThis study aims to inform clinicians about effective exercise strategies for improving physical function in patients with DPN and potentially establish evidence-based rehabilitation protocols.",

It frequently leads to limitations in mobility and increased fall risk, significantly affecting patients' independence and quality of life. Standard treatments often include pharmacological agents, but their long-term use is associated with adverse effects. As a result, non-drug interventions like exercise are increasingly being promoted as safer and equally effective alternatives.\n\nTai Chi and Modified-Otago exercise programs have individually shown promise in populations with mobility impairments. Tai Chi integrates slow, controlled movements with breathing and mindfulness, making it suitable for elderly individuals or those with chronic conditions. The Modified-Otago program was specifically designed to prevent falls through strength and balance training. While both interventions are beneficial independently, no study has yet compared their relative efficacy in managing symptoms of DPN.",

Social and cultural patterns are especially relevant in the context of diabetes, where lifestyle choices, diet, and physical activity play critical roles (Inoyue, 2012). A comprehensive approach targeting all sectors is essential for effective health promotion. However, despite widespread health initiatives, little is known about their long-term impact and sustainability.\n\nThe Bedouin community in the Negev has some of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in Israel, with 40% of those over 50 affected (internal district data). Despite high disease prevalence, there are low success rates in disease management and high rates of complications. The Bedouin society is experiencing a cultural shift from a semi-nomadic lifestyle to permanent housing, which is altering traditional dietary habits (e.g., home-cooked meals vs. ready-made food). The extent to which these changes contribute to rising obesity and diabetes rates is unclear. Additionally, most research on diabetes in the Bedouin community focuses on adherence to standard interventions without considering how cultural norms could serve as unique coping resources (Maor et al., 2023). Studies on other minority groups suggest that community experiences and worldviews can enhance disease management strategies (Chard, 2017; Duwe, 2016; Sanderson, 2012).\n\nGiven the Bedouin society's strong clan ties, strategies involving collective actions (e.g., family-wide physical activities) may boost participation and treatment adherence (Maor et al., 2023). Therefore, tailored health promotion programs are essential for reducing health disparities in this community.\n\nIn Israel, despite overall high life expectancy, minority groups-especially those in lower socioeconomic strata-experience significantly shorter life spans. This gap is largely due to higher rates of chronic conditions like obesity and heart disease among Arab populations (Swinburn et al., 2011; ICDC, 2012). A 1999-2000 survey found that obesity rates (BMI \\> 30) in the Arab sector are notably high (Abdeen et al., 2012). A subsequent study involving 17,044 Arab participants (49% men; average age 39.4) and 16,012 Jewish participants (50% men; average age 40.5) confirmed significantly higher BMI and other risk factors (e.g., HDL-C, triglycerides, SBP) in the Arab population (Abdeen et al., 2012; Kalter-Leibovici et al., 2012).\n\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the Arab sector is roughly double that of the Jewish sector (Kalter-Leibovici et al., 2012; Abdeen et al., 2012). Adherence to treatment is particularly low among Bedouins, with over 70% of patients non-compliant, leading to severe complications such as kidney failure and blindness (Chard, 2017; Duwe, 2016). This highlights an urgent need to understand how Bedouin patients manage their condition.\n\nResearch Objectives General Objective: This study aims to evaluate whether a community-based intervention targeting healthy lifestyle practices within Bedouin clans can improve physical activity, glycemic control, anthropometric measures, and dietary habits in individuals with metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes beyond routine medical care provided by physicians and clinic staff.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nTo examine the effect of the intervention on the Mediterranean diet score among patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes over a period of up to one year from their entry into the study.\n\nSecondary Objectives: Among people with overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes over a period of up to one year, to examine the effect of the community intervention on:\n\n1. Fasting blood sugar levels (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HBA1c)\n2. Blood lipid profile (LIPID PROFILE)\n3. Anthropometric measures (weight, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure)\n4. Nutritional intake quality\n5. Health habits and physical activity level\n6. Quality of life\n7. Sense of social belonging We aim to examine whether a healthy lifestyle intervention program within the clan in the research group compared to the control group will lead to improvements in these outcome measures.\n\nNumber of Participants and Planned Study Centers:\n\nNumber of participants in the study: 170 participants Each intervention group requires 70 people (total 140 participants) + 15 participants in each group in case of dropout (total 170 participants). The intervention group will receive a program to promote a healthy lifestyle. The intervention will be given separately to men and women. There will be 10 meetings. The meeting topics are detailed in the research timeline table. The control group will not receive an intervention program.\n\nThe sample size was based on the following assumptions: The sample size was calculated to demonstrate a difference of 0.5\u00b11% in HbA1c levels in a two-sided test \u03b1=0.05.\n\nParticipant Recruitment Method: Patients insured by Clalit Health Services from two selected clans in Rahat, whose elders agreed to participate in the study, from the Southern District, men and women aged 18 and above, will be recruited by the researchers in the study who are the primary treating physicians identifying suitable patients for participation in the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Recruited patients will be referred for further testing and treatment.\n\nStudy Design and Methodology:\n\nStudy Design: The study is designed as a controlled community intervention trial. Participants will be divided into two groups: an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group will receive a comprehensive community-based intervention program, while the control group will receive routine care. All outcome measures will be measured at baseline, 6 months from baseline and 12 months from baseline.\n\nReporting of Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events:\n\no At each visit, patients will be questioned about changes in their medical condition and changes in their regular medications. If an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it will be reported to the principal investigator and the study initiator according to the requirements of the Helsinki Committee and GCP procedures. The principal investigator will complete an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event report form as required.\n\n* The principal investigator will compile data from all participating clinics.\n* Each patient will be assigned a coded number in a sequential order, consisting of the initials of the patient's name and their recruitment order in the study. Identifying details will be omitted.\n* The encrypted data file will be stored on the principal investigator's computer in the office of Dr. Muflah Ataika at the Clalit Health Services district management in Be'er Sheva.\n* Study documents, including informed consent forms, research questionnaires, and other related materials, will be stored in a locked cabinet at the research site with restricted access to the research team only, according to good clinical practice (GCP) procedures.\n* Identifying details will not be transferred to the study initiator outside of Clalit facilities; only coded data will be transferred.\n\nLaboratory Tests and Any Other Relevant Tests to be Conducted During the Study and Follow-Up Period, and Where They Will Be Performed:\n\n\u2022 Laboratory tests will not be specifically conducted for the study but will be extracted from the participants' medical records during each clinic visit. Anthropometric measurements will be actively checked at each meeting.\n\nMethod of Analyzing and Processing Results:\n\n* Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS and/or SPSS software.\n* For continuous variables, a normal distribution analysis will be conducted and, if necessary, a logarithmic transformation.\n* Comparisons between continuous variables will be performed using appropriate statistical tests such as ANOVA (general comparison, and if necessary, between all groups and between each pair of groups).\n* Comparisons of categorical variables will be performed using the Chi-square test and, if possible, the Fisher Exact test.\n* For continuous outcome variables, a multivariate prediction model will be built, including demographic background factors of the participants and the intervention group they were part of.\n* Multivariate comparisons will be conducted using logistic regression or multivariate linear regression as appropriate.\n\nRole of the Sub-Investigators in the Study:\n\nThe sub-investigators will oversee all stages of the study implementation and intervention, including training research assistants on research questionnaires and medical teams (dietitians and physiotherapists) to integrate the intervention among the population. Additionally, they will supervise data collection, oversee the work of research assistants, conduct statistical analyses (on de-identified data), and write the research findings.\n\n7\\. Ethical Issues of the Trial\n\n* All subjects will sign an informed consent form prior to inclusion in the study.\n\n  \\- Pregnant women, special populations, individuals lacking judgment capacity, and children will not be recruited for the study.\n* Participants can withdraw from the study at any time.\n* Number of centers in the study: This study involves one center, the primary investigator's clinic.",

    "detailed_description": "Insulin resistance is commonly associated with obesity and is a major contributor to the development of obesity-related metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Most persons with obesity are \"metabolically unhealthy\" (MUO), often defined by having insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. However, a subset of people with obesity are metabolically healthy (MHO) and protected from the adverse metabolic effects of excess adiposity. The mechanisms that determine the differences in metabolic health between people with MUO and MHO are not unclear. This project will examine the effects of plasma and adipose tissue small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) on multi-organ insulin action. The investigators will isolate sEVs from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies and blood samples obtained from human participants with MHO, MUO or who are metabolically healthy and lean (MHL) and examine the effects of these sEVs on insulin resistance in muscle, liver and fat cells in culture and on multi-organ insulin sensitivity in lean and obese mice. The investigators will also identify differences in the potential bioactive molecules, namely miRNA and bioactive lipids, that are carried by sEVs. The results from this study will help determine whether plasma or adipose tissue sEVs in people who are MHL, MHO, or MUO are involved in regulating liver, muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. These results could identify novel pathways that regulate metabolic health in people and provide the foundation for exploring the potential of sEVs as a therapeutic target to prevent and treat the metabolic complications of obesity.",

    "brief_summary": "Dietary factors contributed to nearly 50% of all cardiometabolic deaths in the US in 2012, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death in the US, second only to tobacco use. Human diets and food choices can't help but be influenced by the ubiquitous availability of processed foods of high-energy density and low nutrient content, consumption of which can lead to obesity, type II diabetes, heart disease, and other types of metabolic dysfunction. Surprisingly, food reinforcement does not rely on perceived energy density. Rather food reinforcement is associated with actual energy density and therefore, on an implicit knowledge of caloric content. That implicit knowledge must have a neural signature and a mechanism by which the gut communicates nutritive value to the brain. There is evidence, at least for fat and carbohydrates, that these pathways are separable, but terminate in a common neural structure, the dorsal striatum or caudate. This could be one mechanism by which modern processed foods high in both fat and carbohydrate are so sought after and readily consumed, In fact, when experimentally tested, fat and carbohydrate combinations were more reinforcing calorie for calorie than fat or carbohydrates alone and the level of reinforcement correlated with activity in reward- related brain areas. Beyond simple reinforcing value, it is known from the literature on drugs of abuse that the faster a drug is arrives at the brain, the higher it's abuse potential, however, little is known about how the kinetics of nutrient excursion influence food preference, choice, and brain activity. This project aims to test this specifically for carbohydrate reward.",

    "detailed_description": "The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is rapidly increasing worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Tight glycemic control via diet and lifestyle modification is critical to treating GDM and preventing its adverse health consequences, including increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), in women and their children. However, in many resource-limited countries including Nepal, time for diet/lifestyle counseling often competes with other components of antenatal care. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can be leveraged to promote healthy behaviors, and support self-management and treatment of GDM, but this approach has not been tried previously in any LMICs. Taking a user-centered design approach, here the study investigators propose to develop a culturally-appropriate smartphone application (app) to support self-management of GDM (GDM-DH), and test its usability and preliminary efficacy, among patients in a tertiary level, university hospital of Kathmandu University, Nepal. Based on the Social Cognitive Theory framework for behavior change, this app will assist in self-management of GDM by increasing the patient's knowledge and self-efficacy to adhere to the recommended diet and physical activity regimens. The app will also help clinicians by generating easily digestible visual displays of patient data and behaviors, which can aid in their clinical decision-making and counseling. In the requirements gathering phase, 6 GDM patients will be recruited into a focus group to view paper prototypes and provide feedback on its features and functions. Additional questions will be asked about their perceived barriers, facilitators, and strategies for lifestyle modification. Key informant interviews will also be conducted with 5 clinicians (gynecologists, dietician, physical therapist) and 3 family members, asking them to provide feedback on the GDM-DH prototype, especially pertaining to the usefulness and format of the graphic summaries of patient data. After revising paper prototypes and developing the first digital prototype, six additional patients with GDM will be recruited for two rounds of usability testing including think-aloud protocol and focus group discussions. Final prototype will be developed following an iterative process of product design and user testing. After developing the app, the investigators will recruit 120 women who are newly diagnosed with GDM, and randomly assign them to one of two treatment conditions: either (A) standard care + telemonitoring alone, or (B) GDM-DH app + standard care + telemonitoring, from 30 weeks of gestation to delivery. All participants will receive bio-monitoring devices for the self-monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose. Although the fundamental elements of the telemonitoring support are the same between the two groups, patients in the app group will be able to leverage the technological features in the app to aid with self-monitoring.\n\nIn addition to 120 women with GDM, we will also be enrolling 100 women who do not have GDM but failed the glucose challenge test (GCT) in the first screening step of the 2-step diagnostic test for GDM. Women who had high GCT (thus failed the GCT screening) but are not diagnosed GDM are also at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and are also recommended to adopt diet/lifestyle modification in our study site (Dhulikhel Hospital). In addition to randomizing 120 GDM women in a clinical trial, we will also randomize 100 high GCT women to one of two treatment conditions: either (A) standard care alone or (B) GDM-DH app + standard care, for the rest of their pregnancies.\n\nBlock randomization will be utilized to split GDM patients and high GCT patients evenly amongst the two treatment groups. The 120 GDM women will be randomized into two groups of 60. The high GCT women will be randomized into two groups of 50. Patients in Treatment A will receive standard care alone, regardless of diagnosis. Patients in Treatment B will receive GDM-DH app + standard care. All women diagnosed with GDM will receive telemonitoring in addition to their standard care, whereas women diagnosed with high GCT only will not.",

The study will also advance the development and implementation of this peer mentoring model to improve the psychosocial health of adolescents with T1D.",
    "detailed_description": "Rationale: Empowering adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to increase daily physical activity (a cornerstone behaviour in diabetes self-management) is well-defined knowledge gap in pediatric endocrinology clinical practice. Adopting a lifestyle that includes regular physical activity (PA) is essential for the optimal health and quality of life (QoL) of adolescents living with T1D, however Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines provide no evidence for optimal behavioural approaches for achieving the extensive self-management behaviours needed to prevent diabetes-related complications during a critical stage of psychological, social and emotional development. As such, daily PA levels remain low in adolescents with T1D and many do not meet current recommendations for daily PA. The aim of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility, preliminary efficacy and safety of a novel peer-led behavioural intervention to increase PA and quality of life for adolescents living with T1D.\n\nMethodology: Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a peer-led, behavioural intervention, to standard of care on daily PA and quality of life. Investigators will also conduct a qualitative study within the trial to understand the contextual factors that influenced the peer mentoring approach to empowering adolescents with T1D.\n\nPopulation: Sixty adolescents 13-17 years of age living with T1D from 2 sites in Canada who will be randomized 2:1 to intervention or control arms, respectively.\n\nIntervention Arm: A 12-week behavioural intervention guided by the tenets of self-determination theory, and led by a physically active young adult mentors, 21-30 yrs of age living with T1D. Mentors will rely on motivational interviewing skills to support adolescents living with T1D to increase daily PA by fostering a sense of autonomy for goal setting and self-management skill acquisition, competency in their ability to increase daily PA without compromising glucose management and a sense of relatedness to a community of adolescents overcoming similar challenges.\n\nControl Arm: Adolescents in the wait-list control arm will receive standard clinical recommendations to increase daily PA.\n\nInvestigators will also conduct a qualitative study with 10 adolescents who participated in the intervention. The qualitative component will attempt to (1) identify the complex factors that influenced adherence to the intervention; (2) determine the appropriateness and relevance of peer mentoring for adolescents with T1D; (3) explore sex, gender and psychosocial-specific factors related to the delivery of the peer mentoring intervention; and (4) explore possible novel mediators of the effect of the study arms on psychosocial health, quality of life and health behaviours.\n\nTiming: Feasibility and fidelity outcomes will be assessed throughout the trial and at the 12-week time point.\n\nPatient-engagement: Patient co-researchers from Canada and Ireland participated in several formative studies that informed this proposal. They co-designed the novel peer-led intervention and all aspects of the trial outlined in this proposal.\n\nImportance: The results of this trial will inform a larger trial to provide much needed empirical evidence for inform pediatric diabetes clinical practice guidelines for behavioural strategies to improve self management and quality of life for adolescents living with T1D.",

Notably, diabetes significantly increases the risk of cognitive dysfunction, which is classified into preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment and dementia based on the disease severity. Cognitive dysfunction is a critical contributor to disability and mortality in elderly diabetes patients. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for delaying disease progression, enhancing treatment efficacy, and mitigating the impact of dementia. Currently, research and clinical management of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with diabetes are in their infancy, characterized by limitations such as single-center studies, limited sample sizes, inconsistent diagnostic criteria, and insufficient data sharing. Consequently, clinical diagnosis and treatment strategies are underdeveloped, medical staff's related knowledge is lacking, and potential therapeutic targets remain unexplored. In view of these problems and shortcomings, the population cohort study is supposed to be carried out based on accurate diagnosis and constructed the high standard information and sample bank. The study will establish the standard and quality system of T2D with cognitive dysfunction cohort study (unified standards and norms). The study will integrate the standard biological samples stratified acquisition function module (homogeneity and precision) of cognitive dysfunction in T2D, and complete the construction of biological samples bank and clinical diagnosis and treatment information database. The study will apply and develop brain structural and functional imaging technology to support precision diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction in T2D.",

Do the bacteria in the gut change how seizure medicines work for each person?\n\nEpilepsy is a brain condition that causes seizures. Even though there are many medicines for epilepsy, some people still have seizures or side effects. Studies in animals show that gut bacteria can raise or lower the chance of seizures. Smaller studies in people suggest the same thing, but they have been limited in size and scope.\n\nIn this study, researchers will collect biological samples from people who have newly diagnosed epilepsy and from people without epilepsy (called healthy controls). The samples will be tested to learn which bacteria are present. The researchers will then look for patterns that may explain which types of epilepsy are linked to changes in the microbiota.\n\nThe study will also look at whether the bacteria in the gut and mouth affect how well anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) work. For example, the researchers will explore if certain bacteria make medicines work better or worse.\n\nPatients will provide blood, stool and saliva samples. If collected for medical reasons, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - the clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord -will also be used.\n\nHealthy controls will provide stool and saliva samples only\n\nAll participants will be asked to fill an online questionnaire to share health and lifestyle information.\n\nPatients also allow researchers to confidentially access data from medical records related to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nBy comparing data from many participants across Sweden, researchers hope to understand how gut and mouth bacteria influence epilepsy and seizure control.\n\nThis research may help doctors in the future to use a person's microbiota profile to choose the best seizure medicine. The long-term goal is to improve seizure control, reduce side effects, and raise the quality of life for people living with epilepsy.",
    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nClinical studies in humans on the role of the microbiota in promoting seizures and epilepsy are sparse and limited to small, heterogenous cohorts of epileptic patients already treated with ASMs. Larger, treatment-na\u00efve cohorts followed longitudinally are needed to investigate the role of the microbiota in seizures and anti-seizure drug therapy. EpiGUT is building such a cohort in order to study both the oral and gut microbiota by analysis of saliva and fecal samples (primary outcomes). Blood and CSF samples for metabolic and inflammation profiling are collected to analyze how the microbiota may influence systemic and central inflammation and metabolism (secondary outcomes).\n\nIn vitro, non-antibiotic drugs can inhibit growth of gut microbes and microbes can metabolize drugs to produce active or toxic metabolites. In vivo, almost nothing is known about the interactions of the microbes and ASMs. Yet these interactions can profoundly influence treatment outcome, as demonstrated for anti-PD1 therapy of patients with cancer as well as for many other treatments of various diseases. It is thus plausible that individual differences in the gut microbiota may be part of the reason why some individuals respond to certain ASMs, and others do not. By confirming this hypothesis and further in vitro validation of specific drug-microbe interactions we can create valuable clinical guidelines for personalizing anti-seizure treatments based on the composition of the gut microbiota, thus increasing the probability of a positive treatment response of the individual patient.\n\nStudy design:\n\nEpiGUT studies individuals with newly diagnosed epilepsy and their microbiota in response to different ASMs both on an individual level and in comparison to healthy controls. We will analyze the gut and oral microbial composition and function at baseline, i.e., time of diagnosis and study associations with specific subtypes of epilepsies. Building a unique sample collection of blood and CSF enables mechanistic studies on how specific microbes may modulate seizures through metabolites or inflammatory signaling. We will also study correlations between components of the microbiota and ASM treatment efficacy, as well as drug therapy-associated alterations in the gut microbiota.\n\nIn the initial part, we have two sampling time points, at baseline, i.e., time of diagnosis and at follow-up at the time of evaluation of monotherapeutic outcome at three months (or before start of additional ASM, if earlier). About 30% of patients will present with drug-resistent epilepsy. Those will be asked to provide additional samples and quetionnaire answers before and after alternative treatment which may include the ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation or surgery.\n\nMethods:\n\nOur primary outcome variable is the composition of the oral and intestinal microbiota, both on a taxonomic as well as functional level. This will be measured by high throughput whole-metagenomic sequencing of saliva and fecal samples with a minimum of 10 million reads per sample which provides a detailed microbial profile. The role of the microbiota for both research questions will be analyzed using advanced metagenomics-specific bioinformatics tools as well as state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to identify microbial predictors of seizures and/or ASM therapy outcome. Blood levels of ASMs are measured routinely during follow-up and will be correlated to prescribed dose and components of the gut microbiota to identify potential candidates of ASM metabolizing intestinal microbes. Clinical data such as patient history, epilepsy classification, etiology, seizure burden and current medications will be entered in an anonymized Redcap database. In addition, patients/caregivers will be asked to answer a questionnaire with standard questions relevant to microbiota studies including other diagnoses, dietary habits, oral health, birth mode, physical activity etc. PERMANOVA analysis will identify significant factors contributing to our main outcome, the microbial composition. Regression analysis will take these significant factors into account when analyzing the contribution of microbes to the diagnosis or ASM therapeutic outcome.\n\nIn addition, we biobank blood samples collected at both time points and CSF at baseline (only if taken as part of the clinical workup) to analyze inflammatory and metabolomic profiles of the patients using the Olink\u00ae inflammation panel and untargeted metabolomics. These profiles will be analyzed both independently and in relation to the microbial profiles to identify host and microbiota-mediated disease- and therapy-relevant factors as secondary outcomes.\n\nSelection of participants:\n\n1,000 patients will be recruited, 300 children and 700 adults from university and regional hospitals across Sweden A healthy control group will be recruited in a 1:2 ratio and matched by age.\n\nData analysis and statistics:\n\nData analysis will be performed using advanced metagenomics-specific bioinformatics tools. The diversity of the resulting baseline taxonomic and functional profiles will be analyzed for confounding and other influencing clinical and lifestyle factors and ranked by effect size (R2) and statistical significance (p) in relation to our variables of interest (e.g. epilepsy type, seizure burden and refractoriness, etiology) using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA). We will apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to identify microbial predictors of seizures and/or AMS therapy outcome. The most important microbial features of the best model will be extracted and tested in silico as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and/or therapeutic outcome.",

The cause for the increased fatigability in people with Pre-D is not known. Given the profound vascular disease present in people who have had uncontrolled diabetes for several years, we will determine whether dynamic, fatiguing contractions of the lower limb muscles in people with Pre-D are limited by vascular dysfunction at multiple levels along the vascular tree including the artery, arteriole, and/or capillary. This clinical trial involves a novel exercise training regime involving blood flow restriction to the exercising limb will be used as a probe to further understand the vascular mechanisms for increased fatigability in people with Pre-D and T2D. The long-term goal is to better understand what limits exercise and functional performance in people with diabetes to help develop targeted, more effective exercise programs.",
    "detailed_description": "The aim of the clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of dynamic resistance exercise training coupled with blood flow restriction to improve fatigability and vascular function in people with Pre-D and T2D.

This novel intervention has been shown to improve vascular function in young and older adults but has not been investigated in people with Pre-D and T2D. Endothelial function in intact large conduit arteries and arterioles isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies will be measured before and after the training intervention to assess whether the novel training improves vascular function along multiple levels of the vascular tree in people with Pre-D and T2D. Skeletal muscle blood flow through the femoral artery will be quantified with Doppler ultrasonography and skeletal muscle oxygenation will be measured with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a dynamic fatiguing knee extension exercise. We will closely match participant groups for physical activity levels, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), because these confounders are not typically controlled for in other human studies.",

It will also look at how these prompts affect doctor and patient behaviors.\n\nThe main questions are:\n\nDoes the EMR prompt reduce the number of patients who progress to diabetes within six months? Does it improve follow-up care, such as blood tests, referrals, and medication?\n\nResearchers will compare clinics that use EMR prompts with clinics that do not.\n\nParticipants will:\n\nReceive usual care for pre-diabetes at their polyclinic In some clinics, doctors will see EMR prompts suggesting tests, referrals, and medication Complete surveys about their health and lifestyle at different time points",
    "detailed_description": "This is a two-year cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted across eight primary care polyclinics within the National University Polyclinics (NUP) network in Singapore. These clinics provide multidisciplinary family medicine and chronic disease management services to a large and diverse population. All sites use a unified Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system (Epic, National University Health System cluster), which supports standardized workflows, integrates clinical decision-support prompts, and enables secure extraction of de-identified data for research.\n\nThe study targets adults aged 40-59 years with pre-diabetes. All clinicians in both intervention and control clinics will receive the same clinical training on updated pre-diabetes clinical practice guidelines and standardized patient education materials. The updated workflow emphasizes lifestyle modification and behavioral advice as the foundation of diabetes prevention. Clinicians are guided to refer patients to a dietitian and a lifestyle program if BMI is 23 kg/m\u00b2 or above, counsel patients on nutrition and physical activity, schedule a six-month follow-up review, order HbA1c testing prior to the next review, and consider metformin initiation if HbA1c exceeds 6.5% after six months of lifestyle intervention, especially in adults under 60 years with BMI \u2265 23 kg/m\u00b2. Training will be conducted virtually during protected lunchtime sessions. All clinics will implement the new pre-diabetes clinical workflow and education materials, enabling comparison of clinician adherence and referral behavior before and after the introduction of the workflow.\n\nThe study consists of three sequential phases: Phase 0 (Baseline), where no workflow is implemented and baseline EMR and survey data are collected; Phase 1 (Workflow Phase), where the standardized pre-diabetes workflow is implemented across all clinics; and Phase 2 (Prompt Phase), where EMR smart-set prompts are introduced only in intervention clinics to evaluate whether prompts further increase referrals, follow-up scheduling, HbA1c testing, and metformin orders. Control clinics continue using the workflow without prompts. The EMR smart-set prompt is designed to be non-intrusive, offering decision-support options without interrupting workflow or overriding clinical judgment. Clinicians maintain autonomy to accept, modify, or dismiss suggested actions.\n\nA sub-sample of approximately 300 patients will complete questionnaires assessing lifestyle behaviors and activation (using the Consumer Health Activation Index, CHAI) to complement EMR-based outcomes. Approximately 77 clinicians will complete an anonymous FormSG survey assessing knowledge, confidence, and behavior using the COM-B framework. All data-clinical and survey-will be collected prior to intervention implementation. Follow-up data will be collected at multiple time points to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes.\n\nIntervention components include workflow and education for all clinics and EMR-based prompts for intervention clinics only. Smart-set prompts integrated within Epic display automated reminders at the point of care, with options to operationalize orders for lab tests, referrals, medication prescriptions, and follow-up scheduling. Prompts are non-mandatory to preserve clinician autonomy. The intervention draws on the COM-B model to enhance capability (via training and guidelines), opportunity (via EMR environment and referral systems), and motivation (via feedback and reinforcement). The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) will monitor progression through stages of change among both patients and clinicians.\n\nData will be collected electronically using FormSG, a secure, government-hosted survey platform approved for research use. All information will be stored on institution-approved, PDPA-compliant servers, with access restricted to authorized study personnel. Identifiable and de-identified datasets will be stored separately to ensure confidentiality. De-identified datasets will be transferred to data analysts through encrypted, password-protected channels. Only the Principal Investigator will have access to the linkage file containing study IDs and personal identifiers. Hard-copy consent forms will be stored in locked cabinets accessible only by the PI. All study data will be retained for six years following study completion, in accordance with institutional policy. After this period, electronic data and backups will be permanently deleted using secure data-destruction protocols, and physical records will be shredded.\n\nAnalyses will follow an intention-to-treat approach, including all participants within their assigned clinic groups. Baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively. Within-clinic changes over time will be examined using paired comparisons, and between-group differences will be evaluated using mixed-effects logistic regression adjusting for clustering and baseline measures. Additionally, time-to-event analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression will assess time to diabetes conversion, accounting for varying follow-up times. Subgroup analyses will explore differences by demographic characteristics and baseline HbA1c levels. Missing data will be managed through multiple imputation, and sensitivity analyses will test result stability. All analyses will be performed with two-sided tests at the 5% significance level.\n\nOutcome data will be collected at baseline, six months, twelve months, and at 18 and 24 months to evaluate longer-term changes post-EMR implementation. Baseline measures will capture pre-intervention indicators, while subsequent measurements will assess short- and long-term effects of workflow and EMR-prompt implementation.\n\nThis will be the first cluster-randomized trial in Singapore to evaluate a non-intrusive EMR-embedded decision-support system for pre-diabetes management. Findings will inform integration of digital decision-support tools and behavioral interventions into primary care, strengthening preventive diabetes strategies at scale.",

Consequently, it is unclear whether diabetic subjects truly have both low plasma and high urine vitamin C concentrations. We propose that low plasma vitamin C concentrations in diabetic subjects are due in part to inappropriate renal loss of vitamin C in these subjects but not in healthy controls. We will study nondiabetic controls and cohorts with diabetes. Vitamin C concentrations in plasma, RBCs, and urine will be measured in outpatients. In those willing to be admitted to the Clinical Center, we will measure vitamin C pharmacokinetics to determine the relative bioavailability for vitamin C in individuals with and without abnormal urinary loss of vitamin C (or renal leak). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will be determined in genomic DNA responsible for the two proteins mediating sodium dependent vitamin C transport, SVCT1 and SVCT2. We will also explore mechanisms underlying abnormal urinary vitamin C loss.",

    "detailed_description": "Liver transplant, the only cure for end-stage liver disease, is a costly and limited resource that increases survival. It is increasingly performed among older adults who have a higher burden of comorbidities, medical complexity, and are at risk of non-adherence. In addition, liver transplant recipients must manage complex immunosuppression regimens to maintain graft function. Inadequate immunosuppression adherence is common post-liver transplant and has many adverse consequences including liver graft rejection, graft failure, and re-transplantation. To maintain their health, liver transplant recipients must also self-manage regimens for multiple chronic conditions beyond liver transplant.\n\nThe TEST Trial intervention is a conceptual framework to address health system and patient level barriers to adherence. By following the Cumulative Complexity Model and the Multiple Chronic Conditions Model, this study focuses on liver transplant recipients and their involved caregivers. The TEST trial leverages the use of electronic health record and Way to Health (W2H) text message system to improve medication adherence.\n\nTEST is a 2-arm, patient-randomized controlled trial at three large, diverse transplant centers: University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Northwestern University (NU); University of Miami (UM). A total of 360 de novo LTRs age 50 or older (n=180 per arm) within 3 months of transplant will be recruited and randomized to intervention versus usual care for 18 months. Interviews will be conducted at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The TEST intervention includes:\n\n* Monthly W2H Adherence Assessment \\& Clinician Alerts\n* Medication Reminders\n* Laboratory and Appointment Notifications\n* Supplemental Self-Management Support\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the TEST Trial to improve adherence to immunosuppressant and non-immunosuppressant medication regimens, functional health status, and health outcomes compared to usual care. Secondary objectives will measure study fidelity and cost effectiveness.",

For purposes of the scope of this project and the study's feasibility, this will be implemented in a group of prostate cancer patients, who may have additional benefits from metformin.",
    "detailed_description": "In this study, subjects with prostate cancer will be randomized to metformin plus educational material for lifestyle modification versus educational material for lifestyle modification alone and followed for up to 10 years. Population-based, retrospective studies have reported improved outcomes, including prostate cancer specific mortality, with the incidental use of metformin in prostate cancer patients. One prominent study is this area from Margel, et al was published in 2013.2 Using the administrative database from several Ontario health districts, men aged 66 with incidental diabetes and prostate cancer antigen (PCA) were studied. The study included over 3000 men and found an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89) for PCA-specific mortality for each additional 6 months of metformin use. There was no relationship to survival with any other diabetic medication.\n\nIn addition to the use of metformin for the prevention of metabolic complications related to obesity and the prevention of diabetes, there are several studies reporting a potential benefit in those with prostate cancer. In a Veterans Administration-based study, more than 87,000 subjects were identified with PCA in the sample.3 The subjects were analyzed in 3 cohorts: 1) no diabetic medication (DM), 2) DM without metformin use and 3) DM with metformin use. Men with DM who were treated with metformin were found to have improved OS (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.78 - 0.86, for mortality) compared to men with DM not on metformin. Reduced cancer specific mortality was also observed in the men with DM on metformin (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 -0.77) in comparison to men with DM not taking metformin (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 -1.00) - the reference group were those without DM. Despite considerable interest in these findings, there is little if any prospective data on the use of metformin in this setting.",

    "brief_summary": "Due to a changed lifestyle with less physical activity, unfavorable diets rich in fat and calories and obesity, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. The diabetes epidemic is associated with significant personal and socio-economic consequences. Despite attempts to prevent the complications of diabetes, this disease is still the leading cause of blindness, chronic renal insufficiency and non-traumatic amputation. It is important to detect early on an increase in blood sugar and treat it accordingly to reduce costs and to minimize the personal suffering of those affected. As the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise, the number of young women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also increases. This is a disorder og glucose metabolism, which occurs for the first time in pregnancy. The causes for this are manifold. Among other causes, the increasing age of the mothers and weight gain during pregnancy are risk factors for gestational diabetes. Although it has been recommended that women with gestational diabetes should be re-examined after the birth of their child, many women have not. The study is a follow-up study to clarify whether insulin secretion disorder in women with and after GDM is a risk factor for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

    "detailed_description": "The occurrence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is continually rising and has become one of the most evidently emerging chronic disease globally. One of the major consequence of Diabetes Mellitus is Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) which is associated with symptoms like pain, tingling, numbness, paresthesia, balance problems and falls etc. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Pakistan was estimated to be 43.16%. Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) causes weakness, numbness and pain in the hands and feet. Sensory disturbance leads to loss of vibration, pressure, temperature and pain. In addition people with DPN experience muscle weakness, loss of ankle reflexes, drop balance, loss of coordination etc.\n\nProprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) is a system that uses diagonal and spiral movements, and different techniques like Reversal of Antagonists, Dynamic Reversals, and Rhythmic Initiation intended at facilitating, strengthening, gaining control of movement. The Otago Exercise Program was originally designed to prevent falls by improving balance. It involves leg muscle strengthening, walking and balance retraining exercises designed specifically to prevent falls and improve balance.\n\nThis study offers a novel approach by comparing the effects of the Otago Exercise Program with a combined PNF and Otago exercise protocol, targeting multiple domains crucial for functional improvement in DPN patients. This study is a randomized control trial and will be conducted for a duration of year, and Non-probability Convenient Sampling technique will be used for the study. The exercises will be performed for 6 weeks and thrice a week for 40-50 minutes on sample of 30 selected through G Power.",

    "detailed_description": "Type-2 diabetes afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide and poses a heavy burden on the healthcare systems everywhere. Recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend enhanced focus on lifestyle management in addition to glucose-lowering drugs. Individual or group-based diabetes education programs can improve glucose control and quality-of-life, but they are resource-intense and long-term outcomes are variable. Moreover, few individuals with diabetes attend such programs because of practical, medical and financial hurdles to attend sessions.\n\nConsequently, there is a large need for complementary lifestyle support that can meet individual preferences in content and timing and reach many patients at low cost. Digital tools have considerable potential for clinical utility. The investigators have previously shown that the digital Livsstilsverktyget ('Lifestyle tool') developed at the University of Gothenburg leads to improved glycemic controls in patients using it regularly (Dwibedi et al., npj Digital Medicine 2022). To make the intervention more personal the investigators have coupled it with a large language model (LLM) to promote reflection on the expert-written content of the Lifestyle tool. Thus, participants interact with the LLM to explore a current area of interest. They then get recommendations from the LLM on relevant texts from the Lifestyle tool. These texts are written by experts (physicians, researchers). The participants go through the text and are then stimulate by the LLM to reflect on how to use the content in daily life.\n\nStudy participants with type 2 diabetes will be randomized to the intervention and the change of long-term blood glucose from baseline to end of follow-up will be compared with participants who are randomized to a control group without access to the intervention.\n\nBlood samples are drawn for analysis of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a measure of glucose control, at baseline, after six months and after twelve months. Blood samples are drawn at their primary care unit. Technical problems are referred to a study coordinator, who also responded to requests to clarify content in a general manner without providing personal advice.\n\nStudy participants are managed by their ordinary healthcare providers throughout the study.",

After the first visit to the doctor, pregnant women without absolute contraindications to exercise will be invited to participate in a multi-site (home, fitness center, university, or hospital) prenatal exercise program delivered either in person or online. The study will be conducted in multiple centers, recruiting women between 13-20 gestational weeks, allocated to in person or online exercise groups for 12 weeks. The exercise intervention will follow international evidence-based guidelines. It includes aerobic, coordination, strength, postural, stretching, and pelvic floor exercises, organized in two weekly sessions lasting 60 minutes each. All sessions will be supervised by qualified exercise physiologists.\n\nAssessments include validated questionnaires (PPAQ, IFIS, etc.) and fitness tests, at baseline and post-intervention. Pregnant women will be asked to answer questionnaires about physical activity (PPAQ), fitness (IFIS), and healthy lifestyle parameters (health, sleep, diet, stress) twice: before starting the exercise program and after completing 12 weeks of the program. The same procedure applies to basic fitness field tests (e.g., to assess balance, flexibility, strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, etc.). All tests will be applied by qualified exercise physiologists.\n\nDemographic data (age, BMI, gestational age) will be described using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range) will be used to summarize baseline characteristics of participants in both groups (IN and ON). Descriptive and inferential statistics will be applied to all outcomes. Comparative analysis of IN vs. ON interventions will be conducted using intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. Comparative analysis will be used to compare changes in primary (physical activity, health-related, and functional fitness) and secondary (lifestyle parameters) outcomes between IN and ON groups over time (baseline and post-intervention). Subgroup analyses will evaluate potential differences regarding maternal age groups (20-34 years vs. 35-50 years). Adjustments will be performed for potential confounders (e.g., maternal age, baseline fitness levels). The significance level of 0.05 (alpha level) will be set for all statistical tests. Power calculations were performed to ensure the study is adequately powered to detect clinically significant differences between groups. For categorical variables, comparative analysis will be performed using chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests.\n\nRegarding additional outcome analysis, the evaluation of interventions and resources will be performed by means of descriptive analysis summarizing the usage and satisfaction with resources (Active Pregnancy Guide, Active Pregnancy YouTube channel, and Active Pregnancy app) and satisfaction with exercise interventions.\n\nThe statistical software SPSS will be used for data analysis. The study has obtained ethics approval from relevant institutional boards. All participants will be informed about the benefits and objectives of the study. Participation in the exercise programs and assessments is free, and they can leave any time without any consequences.

People with rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk of infections, heart problems, and bone issues compared to others. They regularly see rheumatologists, arthritis care physicians, to manage their disease. However, managing these other health problems alongside their main treatment is difficult for rheumatologists due to limited resources. This clinical study is being conducted to see if adding a family doctor to a team of rheumatologists can help. Rheumatologists will complete a case report form about the patient's health and send them to a special family physician clinic. This clinic will focus on improving vaccination against diseases, heart health, and bone strength. They will check if patients need special vaccines to protect them from infections. They will screen for heart disease using blood pressure measurements, and order blood work for high cholesterol and diabetes if needed. They will also review bone health and send people for tests to check their bone density if needed. A change in routines and medications may be recommended after their checkup. Rheumatologists will complete another case report about the patient's health 6 months after their family doctor appointment. The study will assess how these markers of health management improve after this family doctor joins the team. It hopes to prove that this new way of working in the community will give people with rheumatoid arthritis better protection against certain infections, heart problems and weak bones.",

    "brief_summary": "1\\. Introduction\n\nScheduled surgery requires patients to undergo a preoperative fasting period of at least 6 hours to ensure an empty stomach, significantly reducing the risk of perioperative aspiration pneumonia. However, certain medications and/or conditions have been described that can cause delayed gastric emptying, potentially placing patients at risk for aspiration; among these entities are diabetic gastroparesis and the use of GLP-1 analogs as a treatment for diabetes.\n\nGlucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal hormone with beneficial effects on blood glucose control. It stimulates insulin release, reduces glucagon production, and decreases appetite, making it a therapeutic tool for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been approved by the FDA for these indications, and their use is continuously increasing. One of the primary side effects of GLP-1 agonists is delayed gastric emptying, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Recent scientific literature has presented multiple reports demonstrating delayed gastric emptying associated with the use of GLP-1 agonists, including cases of pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia (despite adequate fasting periods). These findings underscore the necessity for anesthesiologists and perioperative physicians to be aware of the potential risks associated with these medications. It is suggested that these drugs be discontinued days prior to elective surgical procedures, depending on dosing frequency. It is essential to assess the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, as they may indicate an increase in residual gastric content and heighten the risk of complications. As the use of GLP-1 agonists continues to expand, it is crucial to recognize and manage the risks associated with delayed gastric emptying in patients utilizing these agents. Further research is needed to establish more precise guidelines and mitigate the perioperative risks associated with these drugs.",
    "detailed_description": "2\\. Hypothesis\n\nThe study will be based on two working hypotheses:\n\nGastric ultrasonography performed by trained anesthesiologists is a useful tool for assessing gastric content and making clinical decisions regarding airway management.\n\n3\\. Methodology\n\nThe reference population will consist of patients undergoing scheduled surgery with a conventional preoperative fasting period (at least 6 hours).\n\nInclusion criteria for the study will be:\n\nPatients taking GLP-1 analog medications. Adults over 18 years of age. Patients undergoing scheduled surgery after a fasting period greater than 6 hours and less than 8 hours (first patient of the morning surgical schedule).\n\nPatients who have been properly informed and have signed the informed consent form, expressing their agreement to participate in the study.\n\nASA I-III classification. Sufficient intellectual capacity to understand the procedure and the equipment used.\n\nExclusion criteria will include:\n\nNot meeting the previously stated criteria. History of esophagogastric pathology or previous abdominal surgery. Hiatal hernia/gastroesophageal reflux disease. Autonomic nervous system disorders. Neurological or neuromuscular diseases. Use of medications/drugs that affect autonomic regulation and delay gastric emptying (opioids) or potentiate it (prokinetics).\n\nPregnancy. Presence of arrhythmias.\n\n4\\. Description of the Intervention\n\nImmediately prior to surgery, a gastric ultrasound will be performed on the patient in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions. A qualitative, semi-quantitative, and quantitative measurement of gastric content and volumes will be conducted according to the algorithm designed by Perlas et al. Data will be recorded in the researcher's data collection notebook. Following this, the anesthetic and surgical procedures will proceed as planned.\n\n5\\. Ethical, Legal, and Economic Considerations\n\nPatients who choose to participate in the study will be asked for both verbal and written consent (see patient information sheet and informed consent form). Since the study is purely observational and will involve no interventions, there will be no legal liability arising from the study that necessitates insurance coverage. Any ultrasound machine available in the anesthesia department will be used for the study, meaning that conducting the study will not incur any additional costs for the hospital.\n\n6\\. Results\n\nThe results will be analyzed by the study investigators, with the ultimate goal of publication in a relevant specialty journal. If any results are applicable for improving standard clinical practice in our hospital, they will be communicated to the Department of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation and to any other interested parties through a clinical session.",

    "brief_summary": "T1D is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies usually assayed separately on venous blood. The use of a combined test on capillary blood using a blotting paper would facilitate the immunological presymptomatic T1D screening in routine clinical practice as it is easy to perform and can be performed at home by families.\n\nHowever the use of a combined test on blotting paper must be validated before it is used in routine clinical practice for preclinical T1D screening purpose at large scale, starting with pediatric first degree relatives of T1D patients: this is the aim of this study, where we will assess the concordance of 3 autoantibodies rates (anti-GAD65, anti-IA2 and anti-ZnT8) between a combined assay on capillary blotting paper and the individual measurement of these 3 autoantibodies in venous blood at the time of discovery of type 1 diabetes (stage 3).\n\nThe combined immunological test used in this study has already been validated (test available on the market: (Biosynex - product code: RL 3ZGl/96D); However, it has never been used on capillary blood eluate from blotting paper. The blotting paper to be used is also marketed and used in current clinical practice for newborn screening (test WHATMAN\u00ae + SAVER CARDS 903x100 - ref: 034955).\n\nOf note: this ELISA 3 screen test does not include IAA. In clinical practice, for stage 3 patients, IAA (from venous samples) is systematically tested for children \\< 6-year-old. For older children they are tested only if the other 3 autoantibodies are negative. (IAA are found more commonly in young children and mainly below 4 years old and mark a higher risk of progression at a very young age. A single IAA positivity in children can therefore justify a closer surveillance in the short term).\n\nHCL choose to validate the combined assay (3 Screen + blotting paper) in symptomatic children with suspicion of type 1 diabetes at stage 3, to be further used for pre-clinical T1D screening activities across Auvergne Rhone-Alpes region.\n\n3-screen tests have already been used in large screening program (FR1DA). Added to this, any positivity must be confirmed by a second measurement of all 4 individual Aabs on a venous blood sample within 3 months of the positive screening according to the French recommendation.\n\nIn addition, although it is usual to consider that the attack is targeted in the islets of Langerhans with the destruction of beta cells, the exocrine pancreas is also the site of inflammation, leading to the rapid reduction of the mass of the pancreas, which can impact beta cell function and accelerate the autoimmune process of T1D. With this regard, the level of immunoreactive trypsin on blotting paper could be an early marker of the progression of T1D.\n\nThe secondary objective of the study is therefore to verify if levels of immunoreactive trypsin on blotting paper, at the time of discovery of type 1 diabetes (stage 3) in pediatric age, is decreased compared to general pediatric population levels. Trypsin measurements will be performed in the study from the same blotting paper and veinous sample as for Aabs. They will be compared to normal values from general population on venous blood and blotting paper (neonatal screening). If trypsin levels are collapsed in stage 3, this marker could be studied in early stages of diabetes and could be an early marker of progression to stage 3, then useful for monitoring early stages. Further studies would then be necessary.\n\nOverview/Hypothesis:\n\nThe research hypothesis are that i) the combined assay of anti-GAD65, anti-IA2 and anti-ZnT8 autoantibodies by a combined capillary blotting paper test is equivalent to the individual measurement of these 3 autoantibodies on venous sampling at the time of discovery of stage 3 type 1 diabetes and ii) capillary levels of immunoreactive trypsin on blotting paper, at the time of discovery of type 1 diabetes (stage 3) in pediatric age, is decreased compared to normal values (in general pediatric population) and could be a prognostic marker.",

    "brief_summary": "SUMMARY\n\nRationale:\n\nThe(small) intestinal microbiota composition has been implicated to play an important role in (human) metabolism, as well as autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to significantly alter the microbiota composition, without any serious side-effects. It was recently demonstrated that multiple infusions of own faeces(autologous) preserved residual beta cell function up to one year after start of the FMT. In a proof-of-principle study it was found that encapsulated autologous FMT provides a safe and feasible option for prolonged treatment on a daily basis, which might stabilize the beta-cell destruction. These exciting findings are potentially transformative for clinical practice and deserve replication in a larger placebo-controlled trial.\n\nObjective: confirm the efficacy and feasibility of daily ingested encapsulated freeze-dried autologous (own)faecal matter on the preservation of residual beta cell function as assessed by C-peptide release upon amixed meal test (MMT) in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D).\n\nStudy design: double-blind placebo-controlled study Study population: n=110, recently diagnosed (\\<100 days of diagnosis) patients with T1D, aged 18-45 years, BMI 18-30 kg/m2, male/female.\n\nIntervention: After inclusion and randomisation individuals will receive for 6 months either placebo or freeze-dried autologous encapsulated FMT in a 1:2 ratio. Subsequently, participants with be followed for 6 months whether beta cell preservation was durable after cessation of treatment.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is long-term preservation of beta cell insulin secretion capacity as assessed by stimulated C-peptide AUC0-120minresponse upon MMT (at0, 6 and 12months).The secondary endpoint pertains to changes in post-meal urinary C-peptide levels, plasma biochemistry (HbA1c levels),glucose time-in-range and subsequentexogenous insulin dose use at 0, 6 and 12months.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation,benefit and group relatedness: This study is considered a low-risk study, 3MMTs will be performed, for which 70 ml of blood samples will be drawn each visit. As of today, no severe adverse events as result of FMT have been reported in this centre and in the ENCAPSULATE trial investigating the feasibility and safety of this approach participants only reported some minor and transient constipation. In addition, the use of autologous faeces comes with a lower(absent)risk for transmitting any unknown pathogens compared to an allogenic FMT. As there currently is no widely applied therapy to preserve beta cell function in type 1 diabetes, encapsulated autologous FMT can have a potential benefit for the participants.",
    "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES This study is designed to confirm whether a microbial intervention based on capsules containing autologous (own) lyophilized faecal microbiota, LFMCs, taken daily for 6 months has beneficial effects on residual beta cell function (C-peptide secretion uponMMT) in recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to placebo. A parallel objective is to assess the impact on glycaemic control.\n\nTo investigate the effect of daily oral intake of autologous LFMCs on:\n\nI Preservation of residual beta cell insulin secretion capacity: assessed by maximal C-peptiderelease(residual beta cell function)upon an MMT, AUC0-120min at 0,6 and 12 months. As an additional marker of residual beta cell function, at home post-meal urinary C-peptide levels will be used.\n\nII Glycaemic control: changes in plasma biochemistry (glucose, HbA1c), glucose time in range (FreestyleLibre), urine (microalbuminuria) and subsequent exogenous insulin dose use at 0,6 and 12months.\n\nIII Questionnaires and dietary intake: validated questionnaires for abdominal complaints, diabetic complications and hypoglycaemia frequency at 0,6 and 12 months. Dietary intake will be registered via online dietary lists at 0,6 and 12months.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a placebo controlled, double blind, single-centre study. After the randomisation, in a 1:2 (placebo:LFMC) ratio using a validated variable block randomization model in Castor, stratified for sex with block sizes 4,6 and 8, participants will ingest the autologous LFMCs or placebo daily for 6months, which will be followed by a follow-up period of 6months. In total, participants will be followed for12months after inclusion.\n\nStudy visits Subjects will in principle visit 3 times in total for this study, with 1 prior screening visit that essentially encompasses participation in the MARVEL cohort (NL85375.018.23, measuring residual beta cell function and questionnaires) and one visit to pick up the second batch of capsules. Each visit will take 180 minutes (maximum of 12 hours over 12 months).\n\nScreening Blood will be drawn for basic biochemistry and patients will hand in the food diaries, questionnaires. In addition, height, weight, blood pressure will be measured and BMI will be calculated. As the faeces is needed to produce the autologous LFMCs, participants are instructed to collect at least 300 grams of fresh faeces. If the fresh faeces is insufficient (\\<300g), participants are asked to collect more fresh faeces and bring thisto the AMC at a later date (but before the baseline visit).\n\nOptional: additional fecal collections. It may be the case that individuals produce insufficient feces at once, in that case participants are asked to bring in addition samples until 300g is reached.\n\nVisit1: baseline visit (0 months) At baseline a MMT will be performed, blood will be drawn for basic biochemistry and patients will hand in the food diaries, questionnaires and their fecal and 2h post-meal urine sample. Thereafter, the participant will start with the LFMCs for 6months. The first capsule is ingested with the investigator present to ensure the participant tolerates the capsules well and has an appropriate intake technique.\n\nVisit 2 (3months): by phone to evaluate compliance and potential side-effects.\n\nVisit3: follow-up visit (6months) During this visit the MMT will be repeated, blood will be drawn for basic biochemistry and patients will hand in the food diaries and questionnaires and their 2h post-meal urine sample. In addition, height, weight, blood pressure are measured again. Participants stop with the LFMCs and return any remaining capsules to the investigator.\n\nVisit4: follow-up visit (12months) During this last visit, the MMT will berepeated, blood will be drawn for basic biochemistry and patients will hand in the food diaries, questionnaires and their 2h post-meal urine sample. In addition, height, weight, blood pressure are measured again.",

    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of an electronic medical record clinical decision support tool on rates of dysglycemia in the hospital, and its clinical and economical outcomes. The study also evaluates the perspectives of providers regarding the tool's usefulness on disease management support, knowledge, and practice performance.",
    "detailed_description": "Approximately 9 million patients with diabetes (DM) are hospitalized annually and over 30% of inpatients without DM experience high glucose (HG) due to their acute illness. HG increases the risk of infectious and non- infectious complications and death, hospital length of stay (LOS), utilization of hospital resources and overall healthcare costs. While glucose control reduces these risks, controlling HG in the hospital is difficult due to multiple barriers such as recognizing and proactively treating glucose abnormalities, and adequately ordering insulin to treat HG in the hospital. Clinical decision support (CDS) is a system that uses computerized person- specific data in the electronic medical record (EMR) proven to improve hospital care. Among the various modalities, alert-CDS is shown to improve care delivery, providers' proactivity, and glucose control specifically in intensive care settings of academic institutions. However, alert-CDS has not yet been studied outside of intensive care units (ICU), or in community hospitals where most patients receive care. Furthermore, its impact on patients' outcomes has not been tested in any setting. The proposed project uses an innovative alert-CDS tool the investigators developed and validated which automatically identifies dysglycemia and inadequacies in insulin administration in the hospital. It alerts clinicians with recommendations to support decision making without superseding their clinical judgement. In the pilot study, it was found that this alert-CDS tool reduced recurrent high glucose levels and shortened LOS. Based on this promising preliminary data, in this project the investigators propose to study the impact of our CDS tool on clinical, economic and providers' performance outcomes among non-intensive care patients both in an academic and a community hospital. This resource will be available intermittently in the EMR every 3 months during 36 months, thus allowing the comparison of 18 months of intervention and 18 months of standard care. Based on the pilot study, a sample size of 12,560 subjects will give an 80% power of detecting 0.34 days (\\~ 8 hours) difference in length of stay, the primary endpoint of our study. The investigators propose the following aims: Aim 1) To determine the impact of the alert-CDS over conventional care on the clinical outcomes of non-ICU patients in an academic and a community hospital. Aim 2) To determine the impact of the alert-CDS over conventional care on the economic outcomes of non-ICU patients in an academic and a community hospital. Aim 3) To determine the impact of alert-CDS for inpatient glycemic control on providers' perspectives, competencies and practice performance between an academic and a community hospital. It is hypothesized that the tool will increase providers' knowledge about dysglycemia allowing them to make better decisions about insulin administration. The anticipated success of our study builds upon a well-established multidisciplinary team of investigators strongly supported by leadership stakeholders in both hospitals. The proposed study has the potential of establishing a new paradigm in the management of dysglycemia in hospitalized patients with a major positive impact on clinical and economic outcomes.",

    "brief_summary": "Although the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is acute, the progression of T1D occurs over many years often in a patchy manner with inflammation in certain lobes of the pancreas, leaving other lobes unaffected and long-lasting beta cells remain functional decades after diagnosis. Psoriasis share several aspects with T1D, e.g. the patchy inflammatory infiltrate consisting of tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells, leaky blood vessels that facilitate leukocyte migration and the increased risk for systemic conditions. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-17 has shown to be increased in both persons with psoriasis and T1D. Activation of IL-17/IL-22 pathway is viewed to be both a hallmark of psoriasis and human T1D. Ixekizumab, an anti-IL17 biological agent, has shown marked therapeutic value in the treatment of subjects with psoriasis in several randomized trials and is currently an approved clinical therapy. Due to the many similarities in the current view of pathogenesis and manifestation of T1D and psoriasis it is possible that Ixekizumab can also influence the disease process of T1D.",

The investigators aim also to validate existing biomarkers of disease severity and explore the pathogenesis of progressive disease using metabolic profiling technologies. A total of 1000 adult Saudi patients (males and females) with T2DM will be recruited. Those with co-morbidities, including hepatic decompensation, will be excluded. Participants will be followed three times for a total of 10 years/patient (Year 2, Year 5, and Year 10), and measures such as dietary evaluations, anthropometrics, and urine, stool, and blood examinations will be performed. Patients who develop NAFLD will be noted, and patterns/changes in the metabolic profile will be examined. For this specific grant (the first 2 years of the whole project), the investigators will be able to recruit the study cohort, do the baseline anthropometric, imaging, and biochemical measurements, and report the prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM. This information will be the basis of subsequent follow-up and allow for validating potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This project will be of high importance at the national level since it will create awareness in the local medical community of the current severity status of NAFLD in the kingdom and will be used as a tool to promote public health awareness in the community.",
    "detailed_description": "The increased prevalence of obesity in both the developed and developing worlds paved the way to the increased prevalence of yet another obesity-related complication significant enough to be considered within the roster of major public health threats: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has been estimated that approximately 20% to 30% of the adult population harbors NAFLD. It is also the most common liver pathology among children of developed countries. Unfortunately, despite the alarming figures, NAFLD remains largely underdiagnosed, probably because of its less aggressive nature and benign presentation compared with other liver diseases. Thus, it is apparent that NAFLD, being a precursor to more serious liver conditions such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, should be given equal, if not greater, clinical significance.\n\nAccumulating evidence has pointed to parallel clinical similarities between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS), the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors with insulin resistance as the common unifying factor. It is well established that persons with MetS are at greater risk of progressing to major chronic non-communicable diseases such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Consequently, patients with T2DM are more likely to develop NAFLD. Obesity is acknowledged as one of the common denominators linking NAFLD, MetS, and T2DM, making dietary and lifestyle modifications the gold standard for the treatment of these clinical entities aside from pharmacotherapy that aims to improve insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is important to better understand the intricate pathophysiology of NAFLD among patients with T2DM so that future interventions will be aimed at reversing complications.\n\nOur current knowledge of NAFLD in terms of prognosis and treatment is promising yet inconclusive, which means that further investigations using prospective approaches are required. Only recently was a consensus design for clinical trials and endpoints for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) reported. In this follow-up study, the investigators attempt to decipher the natural history of hepatic steatosis among patients with T2DM using state-of-the-art methods in a well-characterized Saudi cohort. Diabetes, and its related medical complications, have been identified as one of the priority areas of the National Plan for Science and Technology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).",

    "brief_summary": "Modifiable stroke risk-factors, which include poor lifestyle habits, account for 90 % of the risk of stroke. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) related to cerebrovascular disorders rely on three main factors, including the severity of stroke-related symptoms, the occurrence of stroke complications, and stroke recurrences.\n\nStroke complications and the risk of stroke recurrence are highly dependent on the control of vascular risk factors. Thus, the secondary prevention of stroke involves profound lifestyle modifications including substance use cessation and diet changes.",
    "detailed_description": "National guidelines for stroke clinical practice advocate an immediate cessation of consumption of all substances but without recommendations on specific therapeutic regimens. Yet, the ability to engage and maintain such lifestyle changes depend on the patient's mental health status. Moreover, independently of stroke, emotional impairments or disorders and substance related and addiction disorders (SRADs) are frequent comorbid conditions (dual disorders) with debilitating consequences and the interplay between the two conditions makes rehabilitation more complex.\n\nPost-stroke emotional impairments are frequent, post-stroke depression and anxiety being the most frequent with a prevalence of 30% and 25% respectively. The consequences of these \"invisible handicaps\" are observable across a wide range of stroke clinical outcomes. They have been shown to be associated with increased mortality, reduced functional status, decreased quality of life, medication adherence, efficient use of rehabilitation services and cognitive impairment.\n\nConversely, despite the obvious connection between drugs and stroke, the prevalence and types of SRADs among stroke patients together with their impact and potential interplay with emotional impairments on post-stroke outcomes are still overlooked. The literature is too sparse to guide clinical practice.\n\nParadoxically, clinicians are facing the devastating effects of addiction in this population and must be informed by solid empirical data. Moreover, the COVID19 pandemic has critically favored or exacerbated poor lifestyle habits (legal and illicit drug use, compulsive overeating) and negative affectivity - including mood and anxiety disorders -, not only in the adult but also the adolescent population. In this context, we believe it is legitimate to expect a noticeable impact on stroke incidence and prognosis in the coming years.\n\nIt thus appears that there is an urgent need to allow stroke healthcare professionals to be better equipped to screen and treat problematic substance use in stroke patients. The WHO promotes tools that could effectively support these two priorities.\n\nFirst, the WHO sponsored the development of the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) to address the need for a reliable and valid screening test. The core criteria chosen for the development of such an instrument were the following: adaptable to different cultures, languages and settings; flexible enough to identify different substances and different patterns of substance use; capable of screening for risk as well as for confirmed cases; ability to link easily into a brief intervention; available at a reasonable/or no cost. Planning and development of the instrument followed a three-phase program; the instrument that is currently available is the ASSIST version 3, for which the French language validation has been already conducted among clients attending primary health care, psychiatric, addiction, and geriatric treatment facilities. These study findings strongly suggest that the ASSIST tool would be suitable for stroke populations.\n\nAdditionally, the potential pivotal role of eHealth development has been advocated by the WHO, who considers e-health as a cost-effective and secure use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in support of health and health-related fields. There is a pressing need to develop such a device for the early detection of post-stroke neuropsychiatric complications for each individual patient. The rapid expansion of ambulatory monitoring techniques, such as Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), allows daily evaluations of symptoms in real time and in the natural contexts of daily life. We have previously validated the feasibility and validity of EMA to assess daily life emotional symptoms after stroke, demonstrating its utility to investigate their evolution during the 3 months following stroke and to identify early predictors of post-stroke depression such as stress reactivity and social support, suggesting that EMA could be used in the early personalized care management of these neuropsychiatric complications. Moreover, we have developed an Ecological Momentary Intervention via smartphone to improve the outcome of post-stroke emotional status. This eHealth device uses algorithms for detecting at-risk patients depending on the level of mood symptomatology (DSM5 criteria for depression, generalized anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal risk) measured by a daily 3-5 min EMA at the end of the day. Data are sent on-line via secured servers and coded alerts are sent to the hospital clinical team in case risk levels are reached and/or if high levels of symptom persist. This approach permits clinicians to rapidly contact patients and to initiate psychiatric care without requiring the usual 4-month wait (on average) before the standard care follow-up visit. Specifically, based on the alerts, the care pathway is adapted according to each individual condition. The eHealth device is flexible and can be optimized by implementing algorithms and alerts indexing difficulties in controlling substance and unhealthy food intake.",

    "detailed_description": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, amputations, reduced quality of life, and premature death in the United States, and it is expected that one in three Americans will have T2D by 2050. To stem the tide of this health crisis, new strategies are needed to prevent the progression to T2D from prediabetes-elevated glucose levels that are not yet in the diabetes range. A growing body of research suggests that insomnia is a major modifiable risk factor for progression to diabetes. The proposed study would build off a promising feasibility study to test whether providing cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to patients with prediabetes results in a reduction in glucose levels compared to a patient education control program. If so, this insomnia treatment could be an effective tool to prevent diabetes.\n\nIndividuals with prediabetes and insomnia will be randomized to receive six sessions of a deployment-ready digital CBT-I program, providing standard-of-care treatment for insomnia (intervention arm, n = 150), or a patient education website providing nontailored material about insomnia (control arm, n = 150). The investigators will complete assessments at baseline, at 11 weeks (after the conclusion of the intervention and control programs), and at 33 weeks post-baseline, measuring hyperglycemia, objective and subjective measures of sleep, and potential mediating variables including diet, exercise, and mood.\n\nThe investigators will assess (1) whether individuals randomized to the intervention arm have lower rates of hyperglycemia, as measured by oral glucose tolerance testing and various secondary measures, than individuals randomized to the control arm at 11 weeks and 33 weeks after baseline; (2) whether improvements in sleep after baseline are associated with decreases in hyperglycemia, regardless of study arm; and (3) whether any effects of the intervention on hyperglycemia are mediated by improvements in sleep, diet, exercise, and/or mood.\n\nThis research will serve as a critical step in identifying a potentially dramatic tool for improving health outcomes for Americans at risk of T2DM. Sleep interventions can lead to sustained improvements that are intrinsically rewarding to patients. If effective, digital CBT-I could provide a powerful pathway to preventing diabetes for millions of patients with prediabetes.",

    "brief_summary": "It is now well documented that changes in gut microbiota composition accompany obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and contribute to low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance,and glucose intolerance. It is not yet clear if T2D predisposes the intestine to allow more microbial products or possibly live bacteria to subvert the gut mucosal barrier. However, it is known that hyperglycemia during T2D induces a more permissive gut barrier allowing increased penetration of microbes and their products into the blood. An important next step is to determine which strains of bacteria promote dysbiosis, allowing bacteria or bacterial components to subvert the gut barrier and alter glucose control. It is hypothesized that gut microbes in the colon and other lower gut segments are key modulators of energy balance, glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.",
    "detailed_description": "The gut acts as a barrier to bacteria and nutrients and participates in glucose homeostasis via endocrine actors and the gut-brain-peripheral axis. It is unclear how T2D alters microbes in upper and lower intestine of humans. Studies in animals show that T2D promotes translocation of microbes to the blood and tissues to promote metabolic dysfunction. It is crucial to determine whether bacteria or their components subvert the gut barrier in human T2D, and then to identity the relevant bacterial strains in tissues that control blood glucose. The overall objective of our research program is to demonstrate that specific microbes in the gut, circulation, and key metabolic tissues are involved in the progression of T2D. We will define the microbial signatures of T2D in duodenal biopsies and stool samples by comparing T2D and non-T2D subjects.",

Yet, only limited evidence on the implementation of MMS service in Hong Kong is available. The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the cost effectiveness and effects of implementing MMS in community pharmacies owned by 8 non-government organizations (NGOs) in Hong Kong on humanistic and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension and/or type II diabetes mellitus. The clinical trial aims to look into the following aspects:\n\n* To evaluate the perception and satisfaction of patients on MMS service\n* To investigate whether MMS could improve patients' adherence to their medication regimen, health-related quality of life, health outcomes and health service utilization, as well as their ability to understand and cope with their illness and drug-related problems\n* To identify and categorize the types of drug-related problems identified during MMS\n* To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing MMS in community pharmacies\n\nMMS services will be rolled out in a total of 8 NGO community pharmacies progressively (2 pharmacies per phase) in 4 successive phases. Participants will complete the questionnaires at the following time points throughout the trial, namely 1) during recruitment, 2) baseline (1 month before MMS), 3) 3 months after MMS begins, 4) 12 months after MMS begins, and 5) 24 months after MMS begins. Researchers will compare the results of questionnaires conducted at different time points to identify the potential changes in the effects of MMS. Furthermore, researchers will link up the electronic health records of the participants and identify the potential changes in the health outcomes and health service utilizations after receiving MMS.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a randomized controlled trial which will be conducted across 8 NGO community pharmacies in Hong Kong. The order of providing MMS service by 8 NGO community pharmacies to study participants will be determined by randomization. The time before each NGO community pharmacy provides MMS service to the study participants is considered as the control period (no MMS service will be provided). A total of 8 NGO community pharmacies will be divided into 4 groups and hence 2 pharmacies will have the same length of control period. The control periods will be categorized into 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and 12-month long. It is anticipated that a total of 640 participants will be recruited to the trial. Informed written consent will be obtained from the study participants before the study starts. Since this trial will involve accessing to personal and healthcare information of study participants for analysis, informed written consent will also be sought for the authorization to access clinical data on the Electronic Health Record Sharing System (eHealth) and the electronic health records from the Hospital Authority (HA) for service evaluation and research purposes. Eligible participants will receive MMS service provided by the pharmacists who work in the NGO community pharmacies after the control period. Different study instruments and methods will be used to evaluate humanistic, clinical and economic outcomes.\n\nTo evaluate the humanistic outcomes, participants will complete the validated questionnaires at 5 different time points throughout the trial, namely 1) during recruitment, 2) baseline (1 month before MMS), 3) 3 months after MMS begins, 4) 12 months after MMS begins, and 5) 24 months after MMS begins. Descriptive statistics will be conducted to summarize the participants' characteristics and outcomes of interest. Linear and nonlinear mixed effect models will be conducted for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively.\n\nTo evaluate the clinical outcomes, electronic health records of the trial participants will be extracted from the electronic health database of the HA. The HA is the statutory organization that coordinates all public hospitals and primary care clinics, and is responsible for managing the majority of patients with chronic diseases in Hong Kong. Participants' demographics, medical records and clinical parameters will be collected from the HA clinical management system database. Clinical parameters such as blood pressure and blood glucose level will be used to evaluate the differences between before and after MMS. In addition, the attendance and admission records of A\\&E and hospitalization will also be collected to evaluate the changes in the health service utilization before and after MMS.\n\nFor the evaluation of economic outcomes, a costing study will be conducted to collect the set-up costs and operation costs of MMS service via sending questionnaires to the 8 NGO community pharmacies. Participants will complete the validated questionnaire on health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The differences in health service utilization, medical costs and QALYs in participants before and after using MMS will be estimated. The Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on incremental cost per additional QALY would be calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation will be conducted to test the robustness of estimated costs and QALYs. Finally, a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be constructed to assess the simulated probability over a range of amounts that a decision-maker might be willing to pay the MMS for an additional QALY.",

    "brief_summary": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. However, PCOS is also a lifelong metabolic disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (=insulin resistance). The investigator has found that fat tissue of PCOS patients overproduces androgens and that this can result in a build-up of toxic fat, which increases insulin resistance and could cause liver damage. In a large cohort of women registered in a GP database, the study team have found that androgen excess increases the risk of fatty liver disease. The aim is to identify those women with PCOS who are at the highest risk of developing metabolic disease, which would allow for early detection and potentially prevention of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease. The investigator will assess clinical presentation, androgen production and metabolic function in women with PCOS to use similarities and differences in these parameters for the identification of subsets (=clusters) of women who are at the highest risk of metabolic disease. The investigator will do this by using a standardised set of questions to scope PCOS-related signs and symptoms and the patient's medical history and measure body composition and blood pressure. This standardised recording of a patient's clinical presentation (=clinical phenotype) is called Phenome analysis. The investigator will collect blood and urine samples for the systematic measurement of steroid hormones including a very detailed androgen profile (=steroid metabolome analysis) and of thousands of substances produced by human metabolism (=global metabolome analysis). Phenome and metabolome data will then undergo integrated computational analysis for the detection of clusters predictive of metabolic risk.",
    "detailed_description": "The investigator propose an innovative approach to solving the clinical problem at hand, the lack of identified measurable parameters one can use to predict the risk of future metabolic disease in women diagnosed with PCOS.The chosen approach is the standardised collection of phenome and metabolome data and their unbiased integration by machine learning analysis. Utilising the detailed results of the clinical phenome and metabolome analysis in the DAISy-PCOS Phenome Study cohort, The study will aim to identify distinct subsets (=clusters) of PCOS patients that share similar characteristics. This approach has previously been used by the team to successfully identify distinct steroid markers that can serve as a \"malignant steroid fingerprint\" in urine to distinguish benign from malignant tumours in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Similarly, The investigator have used unbiased analysis of steroid metabolome data to reveal that patients with aldosterone excess also overproduce glucocorticoids and that the latter explains the majority of metabolic disease risk observed in affected patients.\n\nIn the integrated analysis of the DAISy-PCOS phenome and metabolome data, The investigator will apply a variety of methods in the context of connectivity or centroid-based clustering and density estimation. Supervised relevance learning will give insight into markers, e.g. steroids, that are most decisive for the determination of cluster memberships. In addition, The investigator will use state-of-the-art visualisation and machine learning techniques based on adaptive similarity measures.the investigator will use integrative approaches, addressing the heterogeneous data from different sources as a whole, whilst considering data-driven adaptation of generative models for the underlying biological processes. The investigator will employ these approaches to characterise central phenotype clusters affecting large numbers of patients as the basis of personalised management including outcome prediction.",

    "brief_summary": "Newly released guidelines recommend increased physical activity (PA) and reduced sedentary behaviors (SB) to improve glycemia and prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Typically, 30-60 min bouts of PA are advocated per day. Although this approach increases PA, it does not decrease the length of the sedentary periods through the day. This is important because recent epidemiological data suggest that frequently interrupting sedentary time improves glucose control even in people who achieve the recommended levels of PA. Preliminary experimental data suggest that breaking up prolonged sedentary time by performing multiple short bouts (5 min) of PA throughout the day, may improve glycemia more than performing a single continuous bout of PA, and thereby potentially be a novel strategy to prevent T2D. The improvement in glycemia was observed even when the total amount of PA and total energy expenditure were matched, suggesting that how and when PA is performed over the day may matter more than how much PA is done. However, important gaps in knowledge remain including: (1) whether similar benefits on glucose control would be observed in adults with prediabetes, a clinically relevant population that is at high risk of developing T2D; (2) whether these effects are sustained or diluted over time, and (3) what are the mechanistic underpinnings. To address these gaps, the investigators propose to measure the acute and chronic effects of PA breaks on glucose control and the underlying mechanisms in individuals at risk of developing T2D. Sedentary men and women with prediabetes (n=66, 50% F) will be randomized to either an intervention designed to interrupt SB with 5-min bouts of brisk walking performed hourly for 9 hours/day, 5 days/week (BREAK) or a control condition consisting of 45-min of brisk walking performed as a single daily continuous bout, 5 days/week (ONE). The two 3-months interventions will be matched for total active time.",

    "detailed_description": "Fats are present in the body in the form of lipid particles containing cholesterol and triglycerides. Lipid particles can deposit in blood vessels, forming atheromas, blocking blood vessels and leading to heart attacks and strokes. These harmful particles are termed 'atherogenic' particles. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major atherogenic particle. Each atherogenic particle has a protein associated with it called apolipoprotein B (apoB). Cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB levels can be measured in the laboratory. In this study we focus on patients with raised levels of triglycerides (hypertriglyceridaemia).\n\nWe will recruit patients with hypertriglyceridaemia to look at (1) therapeutic targets, (2) genetic causes, and (3) associated neuropathy in these patients.\n\n1. Therapeutic target arm:\n\n   LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary target for lipid-lowering drugs. A drug (commonly a statin) is effective when it lowers LDL-C. Patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and hypertriglyceridaemia on statins may have normal levels of LDL-C; but because the size of LDL particles in these patients is smaller, they may in fact have raised levels of apoB and therefore remain at cardiovascular risk. Thus, measurement of apoB may be a better target for treatment because it measures 'atherogenic' particle numbers. Since atheromatous disease is an inflammatory disease, we will also investigate if residual risk may be correlated with inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and Lp-PLA2.\n2. Hypertriglyceridaemia and nerve function arm:\n\n   We aim to demonstrate that severe hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with more significant nerve damage.\n3. Genetic screening arm:\n\nSeveral genetic mutations have been identified to cause hypertriglyceridaemia. Deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) results in Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease (CESD) and hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and abnormal lipid deposition in organs. We wish to identify genetic mutations associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia and the prevalence of LAL deficiency in patients attending our tertiary referral centre.",

    "detailed_description": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), such as myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The causality of low-density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL-C) level in the development of ASCVD is well demonstrated in previous studies. After introducing LDL-C lowering agents, multiple large-scale randomized clinical trials have demonstrated lower cardiovascular events with lowering LDL-C levels. In particular, for secondary prevention, more aggressive control of LDL-C levels with high-intensity statin therapy significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared with moderate-intensity statin therapy. In addition, the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) proved the clinical efficacy of additive ezetimibe for incrementally lowering of LDL-C levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, there has been limited evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of aggressive lipid-lowering strategy using high-intensity statin with a combination of ezetimibe for primary prevention of cardiovascular events among persons without cardiovascular disease. Although the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 and Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trials consistently identified that the use of rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg) was significantly associated with reduced future risk of major cardiovascular events in patients who did not have cardiovascular disease, those studies have been focused on the use of statin, not on the intensity of statin.\n\nThe coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan, a marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, has become popular for individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. CAC is strongly associated with atherosclerotic burden and predicts coronary heart disease events and mortality, regardless of their age, sex, race, or ASCVD risk. Furthermore, the progression of CAC is associated with an increased risk for future hard and total coronary heart disease events. The use of CAC scoring was associated with significant improvements in the reclassification and discrimination of incident ASCVD. Nevertheless, the current guidelines recommend CAC measurement for selected cases only with borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD to guide the use of statin or not. However, in real-world practice, CAC testing is increasingly being promoted to the public as a means of self-assessment of cardiovascular risk and is widely being used regardless of ASCVD risk. Considering that statin has additional properties, including atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, oxidative stress reduction, enhancement of endothelial function, and a decrease in vascular inflammation beyond their lipid-lowering effect, aggressive treatment with a high-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination might have beneficial effects on the long-term clinical outcomes for asymptomatic patients with significant coronary calcium (Agatston Score \u2265 100) compared with standard lipid-lowering therapy endorsed by the current guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the purpose of DECISION-CALCIUM (Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of High-Intensity Statin and Ezetimibe Combination versus StanDard carE in AsymptomatiC PatIentS wIth Presence of COroNary Artery CALCIUM) trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of the aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with combination of high-intensity statin and ezetimibe, compared with the current standard lipid-lowering therapy in asymptomatic patients with significant coronary calcification for primary prevention.",

    "brief_summary": "The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effects of a 4-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and time-restricted eating (TRE) intervention on cardiometabolic biomarkers in adolescents and young adults.",
    "detailed_description": "As of 2015, an estimated 2 billion individuals were overweight (body mass index \\[BMI\\] \u2265 25 kg/m2), and one-third of them were obese (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2). Obesity has become a serious health concern due to its related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). While adolescents and young adults are considered low risk for the development of CVD, individuals with obesity are still at a greater risk of CVD development than individuals without obesity. Changes to dietary and fitness habits are currently the first-line recommendations for preventing weight gain and improving cardiometabolic health in adolescents and young adults.\n\nCaloric restriction (CR), which involves reducing caloric intake by up to 50% of normal daily calorie intake, is a common dietary intervention approach for weight management and improving cardiometabolic health in adolescents and adults with obesity.9 However, studies have shown that CR is hard to maintain, and individuals tend to regain the weight after the intervention is completed. Time-restricted eating (TRE) has been proposed as an alternative to calorie restriction (CR). TRE, a type of short-term fasting, is defined as periods of no caloric intake followed by periods of ad libitum (as much as desired) caloric intake. The fact that TRE does not intentionally limit energy intake, whereas CR does, could make it more appealing to individuals in terms of adherence, acceptability, and efficacy. TRE is an effective strategy in reducing body fat percentage and waist circumference in adolescents and adults with obesity.\n\nMoreover, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves repeating short periods of intense activity followed by low-intensity breaks, has been shown to be effective in improving cardiometabolic health (including lipids, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity) in adults with obesity compared to other traditional exercises. In addition to its benefits on cardiometabolic health, previous studies have suggested that HIIT can be a time-efficient strategy to enhance body composition and cardiopulmonary fitness in adults with obesity.1\n\nHowever, it is unknown if TRE or HIIT will produce a greater improvement in cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the independent effect of a 4-week TRE and HIIT intervention on cardiometabolic biomarkers in youth and young adults.",

Patients who have been diagnosed with DM type II for at least 1 year and refractory painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities who are scheduled to receive a spinal cord stimulator may be enrolled in this study pending eligibly for all other criteria.\n\nOnce eligibility and consent have been confirmed, each subject will go through a baseline visit where data will collected through a series of questionnaires, a clinical and psychological evaluation by a licensed professional. Subjects will be asked to come back for a series of vascular test prior to their device implantation. This vascular testing will be done at the vascular lab at the University of Chicago Medical Center by trained vascular physicians and techs.\n\nPrior to any study related procedures, all subjects must first sign the approved ICF. This will be performed by the PI or an approved member of the study staff who has been delegated by the PI do so and in a private setting with ample time given to the subject to review and ask any questions regarding the study. Once the ICF has been signed, a copy will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in their research or medical chart.\n\nBackground Data\n\nOnce the ICF has been complete, demographic data such as name, age, gender will be collected. Along with demographic information, we will collect medical, surgical and medication history for each subject at the initial baseline visit.\n\nVascular Testing\n\nBefore the Spinal Cord Stimulator procedure, all patients enrolled in the study will undergo baseline vascular testing. The following test will be performed on each subject. Subjects will only go through this portion of the study if they receive pre-certification by their insurance for their SCS procedure. Below is a list of tests that will be performed:\n\n1. Flow mediated arterial dilation and by measuring pedal and digital level waveforms and pressure.\n2. Doppler flowmetry (Laser Doppler flowmetry if available) by Duplex Scan of lower extremities\n3. Ankle Brachial Index\n4. Pulse Pressure and aortic pulse wave velocity\n5. Peripheral vascular compliance of the lower extremity\n\n   SCS Procedure\n\n   The SCS procedure is being done as part of the subject's clinical care. The subject would be receiving this procedure, even if they do not agree to participate in this study. All patients will have 2 temporary SCS trial leads placed transcutaneously and tunneled to limit the risk for infection. At the end of the trial interval, patients will repeat the vascular testing at 2 weeks post-op at the time just prior to device removal, as well as complete the clinical evaluations as above.\n\n   The SCS waveform used will be consistent and similar for all patients enrolled; at 1 week, study will allow minor SCS waveform modifications to recapture stimulation, but waveforms will be maintained within established parameters in accordance with device used. All patients will attempt to complete the 2 weeks trial; early removal will be performed for the following situations: intolerable pain with stimulation (increase pain \\>4 points from baseline), infection, neurological deficit (sensory of motor), patient request. Leads will be pulled 2 weeks after placement and patients will be seen 1 week after the leads are pulled. At that time, patient will exit the study and can choose definitive implantation if satisfied with the trial results.\n\n   Study Questionnaires and Assessments\n\n   At various time intervals, all subjects will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and assessments. These questionnaires are intended to evaluate their quality of life, pain levels, patient satisfaction, functional capacities and mental health. All questionnaires are validated and have been chosen for a specific study endpoint. Below is the list of questionnaires and a brief description of each one.

Researchers will compare patients who receive digital literacy training to those who receive standard of care (educational sheet) to see if it impacts their use of the patient portal after discharge.",
    "detailed_description": "Latinos have the second-highest age-adjusted prevalence and among the highest incidence of diabetes. Latinos also experience worse glycemic control and diabetes-related complications, including diabetic retinopathy and chronic renal disease. These findings are concerning since Latinos are the largest minority group in the U.S and will account for 25% of the population by 2045.\n\nDigital tools, like patient portals and telemedicine, offer an opportunity to address some of the challenges that lead to these disparities, especially during care transitions. However, Latinos, especially those who are Spanish-speaking are less likely to use digital health tools. Findings from previous health information technology work have highlighted barriers, including 1) digital access and literacy, 2) interface usability, 3) privacy, and 4) patient preference. One promising intervention to address digital literacy gaps is the use digital navigators.\n\nThis study aims are to assess a digital health navigation intervention focused on increasing patient portal use after discharge among Latino patients with type II diabetes admitted to the general medicine inpatient floor.",

The investigators will enroll 280 type 2 diabetes patients, who will take part in either an 8-week intervention (with 16 weeks of supplemental text messages) or an attention-matched, MI-alone condition.\n\nIn this project, the investigators hope to do the following:\n\n1. Examine the efficacy of an 8-week, phone-delivered PP-MI intervention for individuals with type 2 diabetes on physical activity-related outcomes, as compared to the MI-alone condition.\n2. Assess PP-MI's impact on psychological measures (e.g., positive affect \\[key secondary outcome\\]), diabetes self-care, function, glycemic control, and cardiometabolic risk, compared to MI alone.\n3. Examine causal mediation of PP-MI's effects on MVPA at 16 weeks by positive affect (primary hypothesized mediator) and other psychological/cognitive variables across our theoretical model.\n\nParticipants will be adult outpatients with type 2 diabetes. They will attend an in-person visit to provide informed consent and complete baseline outcome measures, then will wear an accelerometer to monitor their physical activity for one week to obtain information about baseline activity levels. Upon confirmation of low moderate to vigorous physical activity, participants will be randomized to receive the PP-MI intervention or the MI-alone intervention.\n\nParticipants in both groups will be provided a treatment manual, an activity tracker, and other treatment materials. The intervention will be introduced, and the first exercise will be assigned.\n\nParticipants will complete eight weekly phone sessions with a study trainer. The phone sessions primarily will include a review of the prior week's session content and a discussion of the rationale and assignment of the next week's exercise/assignment.\n\nParticipants will receive twice weekly text messages throughout the intervention (Weeks 1-8) and initial follow-up period (Weeks 9-16). In the PP-MI condition, these messages will focus on the PP activity and physical activity, while those in the MI-alone condition will focus on physical activity and other health behaviors. During Weeks 9-16, participants in the PP-MI condition will engage with twice weekly, automated, interactive text messages related to PP and physical activity, while those in the MI-alone condition will receive fixed text messages related to engagement in health behaviors.\n\nAt Weeks 8, 16, 24, and 52, participants will complete follow-up visits. One week prior to these visits, participants will be mailed an accelerometer and will wear it until their study visit. During these study visits, participants will complete outcome assessments and have a blood sample taken.",

    "detailed_description": "In earlier studies, a bi-directional link between diabetes and periodontitis has been established: high glucose levels increase the risk of periodontitis while glycemic control is likely to worsen with untreated periodontitis. The treatment of diabetic patients should include easy access from diabetes clinics to oral health care facilities to reduce the potential risks of periodontal disease, or deterioration of existing symptoms of periodontal disease. As part of a holistic approach to healthcare and its resources, more attention needs to be paid to the early detection, and prevention of oral diseases in diabetic patients. Novel testing and treatment methods can play a key role, and a good collaboration between diabetes and oral health care facilities is essential.\n\nThe aMMP-8 test can be used to assess the risk of periodontal disease. If the test is positive, latent MMP-8 is activated, so the inflammatory cascade is activated and provides real-time information. The test can also be used to monitor the success of the treatment outcome and can be used to determine the interval between maintenance treatments. In addition, patients' oral self-care should be improved, as most of the work in preventing oral diseases is done at home. The home use of photodynamic dual light therapy (aPDT) can provide additional benefits and also engage patients not only in self-care but also in the whole treatment process. Preliminary studies show that aPDT improves the treatment and maintenance outcomes, and potentially reduces the risk of periodontal disease in addition to self-care.\n\nThe combination of easy access to treatment could have wide benefits individually, and also at the community level, including the possibility of building a cost-effective preventive care pathway for patients with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and periodontitis, and identifying the risks of both diseases and treating already detected diseases early and in a timely manner.",

    "detailed_description": "Diabetic neuropathy is a microvascular complication affecting 50% of patients throughout their lifetime. It leads to various complications including foot ulcerations and lower limb amputations, thus impairs the patient's quality of life. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is the most common subtype. Symptoms include tingling, burning and electrical pain associated with nocturnal exacerbation. Almost 50% of patients are asymptomatic thus diagnosis must include assessment of signs.\n\nPathophysiologic mechanism behind hyperglycemia induced nerve damage include the activation of various pathways including polyol and advanced glycation end product (AGE), which produces reactive oxygen species. Molecular studies have revealed the involvement of certain transcriptional regulators such as Nrf2-Keap1 and NfKb inflammatory cascade.\n\nNuclear erythroid growth factor-2 (Nrf2) functions primarily as a defense mechanism in cellular oxidative stress, producing anti-oxidant enzymes as glutathione reductase (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). However, in long term hyperglycemia, downregulation of nrf2 takes place, leading to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn activates nfkb inflammatory pathway and produces various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Tumor-necrosis factor is known to be highly associated with nerve damage.\n\nDrugs that target disease pathophysiology are currently unavailable, instead DPN management mainly depends on lifestyle modification through weight loss, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile management along with symptomatic care. Yet these fail to stop disease progression.\n\nMelatonin is known to possess anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties through upregulating nrf2. It's hypothesized that adding it to standard therapy shall activate nrf2, and downregulate nfkb pathway and inflammatory cytokines, improving disease progression and patient's quality of life.\n\nThe aim of the current study is to measure the effect of melatonin on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers and clinical outcome in type 2 diabetic patients with DPN.\n\nAll patients will be assessed for the following data at baseline:\n\n1. Age, gender, diabetes duration, diabetic neuropathy duration.\n2. HbA1c, liver functions, kidney functions and lipid profile.\n\nLab assessment will be done at both baseline and at the end of the trial to assess the effect of melatonin on the following:\n\n1. Nuclear erythroid related factor-2 (NRf2) (an oxidative marker)\n2. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (an inflammatory marker)\n\nAssessment of clinical outcomes will be done as well, at both baseline and endpoint using the following:\n\n1.

Some 37.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes. FQHCs are an important source of diabetes care for one in ten Americans and shoulder a higher prevalence of diabetes (21% FQHC, 11% U.S.), offering a promising venue for innovating in diabetes care. The iPATH project will refine and implement an approach to practice transformation originally conceived to support FQHCs' pursuit of National Committee for Quality Assurance recognition as patient-centered medical homes. A pilot demonstrated significant decreases (average 31% reduction) in poorly controlled diabetes (A1c\\>9%) among patients at 7 clinics affiliated with an FQHC in Puerto Rico in 2017-20. Improvements in patients' diabetes control were sustained pre- to post- Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAim 1. Refine the iPATH implementation approach by identifying organizational conditions and processes at FQHCs that promoted or impeded the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes care. Research teams will simultaneously conduct 12 in-depth regional case studies, enabling contrast between FQHCs considered high-performing and low-performing for diabetes control. Teams will identify actionable, how-to implementation factors for ensuring chronic, preventive, and acute care for patients with diabetes. Employing an innovative Rapid Data Collection and Reporting methodology, teams will rapidly collect, analyze, and share data to accelerate dissemination of customized feedback to FQHC leaders and to inform adaptation and implementation of the iPATH practice transformation.\n\nAim 2. Implement a multi-level, multi-component, technology-enabled practice transformation strategy to improve type 2 diabetes for patients at 8 multi-clinic FQHCs. Teams will adapt, tailor, implement, test, and spread our practice transformation strategy across FQHCs located in California, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Puerto Rico. The iPATH implementation approach will be modularized and customizable to accommodate organizational readiness, patient needs, and social contexts, tailoring practice transformation efforts to each unique FQHC.\n\nAim 3. Comprehensively evaluate the iPATH implementation approach with a hybrid type 2 study, including a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. Including formative, process, and summative evaluation elements guided by the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment model, the study will evaluate impact of practice transformation and identify process elements affecting implementation effectiveness. Analyses will leverage the unique advantage of FQHC data.",

    "brief_summary": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common chronic complication of diabetes, affecting about 50% of patients with diabetes and leading to severe morbidity, poor quality of life, high mortality, and high health care costs. Due to the complex structure and anatomy of the peripheral nervous system, DPN presents with a very broad spectrum of clinical symptoms and deficits, including severe pain, sensory deficits, foot ulcers and amputations. Presently there is no treatment for DPN and even with good blood glucose control DPN develops especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. There is a need to identify effective interventions for DPN. Preclinical studies have provided evidence that the combination of fish oil and salsalate is an effective treatment of DPN. The human subject study to be performed will examine the effect of fish oil with and without salsalate on the blood lipid profile and circulating metabolites of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fish oil is an excellent source for the nutrition dependent omega-3 PUFA, primarily eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6). These fatty acids are the source of anti-inflammatory metabolites known as resolvin, neuroprotectin and maresin. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that the metabolites of EPA and DHA are neuroprotective. Furthermore, when fish oil is combined with salsalate the production of these metabolites is increased in vivo. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that fish oil and salsalate will be an effective therapy of DPN. However, prior to doing a formal study of the effect of fish oil + salsalate on DPN there is a need to learn more about what concentration combination will provide the most efficacious effect on the omega-3 index (defined as the sum of EPA and DHA, as a percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells) and that will safely increase the production of the anti-inflammatory metabolites. These studies will be performed at two sites the University of Iowa (Dr. Yorek) and University of Michigan (Dr. Pop-Busui) by treating human subjects with type 2 diabetes and DPN with either 2g or 4g of fish oil per day (capsules) for 4 months and then adding salsalate 1.5 g or 3g per day (tablets) to the fish oil treatments for an additional 2 months. At baseline and after treatment with fish oil alone and after treatment with the combination of fish oil and salsalate the omega-3 index and levels of circulating omega-3 PUFA metabolites will be determined as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will include determination of circulatory inflammatory markers and non-invasive measurements for DPN. The risks to subjects are minimal and are very reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge to be gained.",
    "detailed_description": "The main objective of the investigators studies is to find a safe and effective disease modifying treatment for DPN by translating their preclinical findings (introduced above) to human DPN. However, in an initial step, the investigators' immediate goal is to determine the most effective dosing combination that will raise the omega-3 index to 8-12 % (postulated to be required for a therapeutic effect) and leading to a maximum increase in circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA metabolites. The overall hypothesis is that a tailored supplementation with fish oil will lead to a therapeutic level in the omega-3 index and combining fish oil and salsalate vs. fish oil alone will safely increase the circulating levels of pro-resolving mediators of omega-3 PUFA and reduce markers of inflammation. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a dose finding clinical trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes with DPN. The Specific Aims are:\n\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine the optimal dose of fish oil needed to safely increase the omega-3 index to potentially therapeutic levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes and DPN.\n\nBased on the investigator's preclinical studies, they hypothesize that an omega-3 index of 8 - 12% will be needed for effectiveness in human DPN.\n\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine the optimal fish oil and salsalate combination on the profile and concentration of circulating omega-3 PUFA metabolites and changes in inflammatory markers in participants with type 2 diabetes and DPN.\n\nThe investigators will utilize state-of-the-art liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine the change in the circulating lipidomic profile of omega-3 PUFA, and antibody-based assays to measure circulating inflammatory markers: C reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha; and interleukins 6 and 10 in response to above combination in human subjects with type 2 diabetes and DPN.\n\nCompleting these aims will establish the optimal dose of fish oil-salsalate combination needed to raise the omega-3 index to potentially therapeutic levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and DPN, and their effect on the formation of the pro-resolving metabolites of omega-3 PUFA in circulation in these subjects.\n\nThe investigators proposed research will have immediate significant impact by generating the knowledge needed for the design of a phase 2/3 trial in human DPN to determine whether fish oil and salsalate in combination is an effective disease modifying therapy for DPN. The safety profile of fish oil and salsalate are excellent making them an ideal choice for chronic treatment of DPN.",

    "detailed_description": "T2DM and prediabetes are characterized by abnormal post-prandial suppression of glucagon, which contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia by increasing endogenous glucose production (EGP). In rodents, altered glucagon signaling changes \u03b1-cell function and mass - an effect mediated by changes in circulating AA concentrations. Are the elevated concentrations of branched-chain AA and other AA metabolites in T2DM a cause or an effect of global \u03b1-cell dysfunction? To measure glucagon secretion, as well as glucagon action, we have developed a population model of glucagon kinetics allowing us to deconvolve secretion from glucagon concentrations in a manner similar to Van Cauter's model for insulin secretion from C-peptide. This enables better characterization of \u03b1-cell function in humans. In addition to our novel methodology, we can characterize \u03b1-cell responsiveness to a graded glucose infusion, by quantifying (G50) - the change in glucose concentration necessary to suppress glucagon secretion by 50%. These experiments will determine if the glucagon secretion in response to AA differs in obese individuals with T2DM from that observed in obese individuals without T2DM.",

Within the principles of each approach, the dietary goals and change will be adjusted according to individual needs/capabilities conducive to long-term adherence. Furthermore, the investigators aim to determine whether the rate of diet-induced remission is reflected in/can be predicted by baseline or diet-induced changes in glucose variability (e.g., time-in-range measured by continuous glucose monitoring) and other factors such as anthropometric changes and genetic susceptibility. Each center will also conduct locally-lead standalone mechanistic research, including analyses of intra-abdominal/hepatic fat accumulation, adipose tissue biopsies and/or measurements of energy metabolism. Additionally, changes in medication use, nutritional status, cardiovascular disease risk, as well as adverse events, will be monitored.",
    "detailed_description": "At least 588 patients with T2D will be recruited, approximately 120-150 men and women at each research center. The participants will be randomised to 1) a nutritional complete formula diet for 3 months followed by an energy restricted diet for 12 months or 2) a very low-carbohydrate high-fat (VLCHF) diet for 3 months, followed by a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet (LCHF) for 12 months. Each of the diets will cover all basic requirements for essential nutrients including amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Participants will be encouraged to consume at least 200 g of vegetables per day. Furthermore, we will emphasize high-quality, minimally processed foods. In arm 2 they will receive advice to eat specific fat sources such as extra virgin olive oil, butter and high-fat cheeses.\n\nThe DiRECT trial showed remission in 46% of participants after 12 months. Assuming that both the DiRECT program and LCHF dietary strategies yield a 45% chance of T2D remission after 15 months, it is calculated (using nQuery v8) that each group needs 235 participants to complete the trial. This sample size yields 90% statistical power to conclude, with respect to the primary outcome, whether the CarbCount Program is no more than 15% more or less effective than the DiRECT principles (equivalence study, one-sided p-value at 0.025). To allow for expected loss to follow-up (estimated at 20%), each of the arms needs at least 294 participants for a total of 588.\n\nParticipants will have access to electronic platforms that include an online database of recipes (breakfast, easy-to-cook lunches, snacks, dinners, and food for special occasions). The platforms will facilitate planning of week menus, and include an e-learning course covering topics such as how to cook and prepare foods, meal planning, dining out, sleep and individual aspects that challenge habit change. If the participants are failing in their efforts to establish or maintain lifestyle change, they will be encouraged to seek possible solutions in the e-learning courses or to contact one of the study's health educators and/or dietitians. Specific rescue plans involving direct contact with study staff will be implemented if a participant regains more than 2 kg or experiences T2D relapse.\n\nAfter individual assessment by a doctor, the participants will be taken off diabetes medication upon starting the diet, and be asked to self-monitor blood sugar changes during the first 2 weeks on the diet, followed by a consultation that includes evaluation of these changes. The need of reintroduction of medication will be done in consultation with the study doctor at least every 3 months.\n\nBetween visits, the participants will complete dietary assessments and an e-learning course, and at least once a month have follow-ups with dietitians/health educators and/or online group workshops.\n\nThe study will enroll eligible participants to the study continuously, until the total number of participants needed for the study is reached. Each participant will follow their own timeline, and attend visits at the study center at baseline, 3, 9 and 15 months.\n\nDuring 2 weeks before each visit, participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and record food intake for at least 3 consecutive days during this period.\n\nMeasurements during visits will include anthropometric variables/body composition and energy expenditure, blood, saliva, urine and stool samples will be collected, and participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires on physical activity, sleep pattern, meal frequency, quality of life, problem areas in diabetes, eating efficacy and eating behaviors. They will also have a consultation with a registered dietitian and meet with the study medical doctor when needed.\n\nA blinded statistician will perform the statistical analyses for the primary outcome of the study.",

    "brief_summary": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a growing public health concern in Saudi Arabia, ranking ninth globally in T1D incidence and tenth in T1D prevalence in children, and the rates are expected to rise and incur greater healthcare costs. Genetic and immunological factors are believed to play a significant role in disease development, and recent clinical trials have shown promise in delaying or preventing T1D onset in high-risk individuals. Early screening for immunological or genetic markers in children is crucial to identify high-risk individuals and provide early intervention. Last year, the American diabetes association's recommended clinicians to screen first degree relatives of individual with T1D. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries lack established T1D screening programs, making early identification and intervention challenging. The benefits of screening include education for symptom awareness, monitoring to track progression to clinical T1D, a five-fold reduction in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset, and improved glucose control for the first years following diagnosis. To address this issue, exploring effective and efficient screening methods in identifying high-risk children and the cultural acceptability, feasibility, and barriers to a broader implementation of such screening programs among Saudi families is crucial. Therefore, the investigators aim to conduct a prospective cohort study among young children and adolescents with a family history of T1D (i.e., T1D first-degree relatives). Children 2-18 years old will be screened using a 5 spots filter-dried blood sample for the following:\n\n1. Islet autoantibodies: IAA, GADA, IA-2A, Zn-transporter autoantibodies using the antibody detection by agglutination PCR (ADAP) assay.\n2. HLA phenotyping\n3. Genetic risk score after the cross-sectional assessment those who are determined to be in stage I, or II of T1D will be offered prospective follow-up for 5 years.",

    "brief_summary": "Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a chronic progressive liver disease caused by nutrient excess and insulin resistance (IR) in genetically susceptible individuals. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, the morbidity and incidence of MAFLD have been increasing globally, particularly in China. MAFLD and metabolic syndrome as well as type 2 diabetes are mutually causal, jointly promoting the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, liver decompensation, and malignant tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma. MAFLD has become an increasingly severe public health issue in China. Effective clinical interventions for MAFLD patients are of great public health significance for the prevention of terminal diseases.\n\nCynara scolymus, silybum marianum, curcuma longa, and glycyrrhiza glabra are traditional Chinese medicinal herbs that have demonstrated significant effectiveness in improving metabolic diseases. Cynara scolymus contains polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenes, and other substances, possessing antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-tumor, anti-microbial, antihypertensive, and kidney-tonifying properties. Silybum marianum belongs to the Compositae family and has the effects of clearing heat and detoxifying, soothing the liver, and promoting bile flow. The active ingredient of silybum marianum is silymarin, a flavonoid compound, which has antioxidant and anti-hepatic fibrotic effects, protecting hepatocytes from damage by free radicals and promoting hepatocyte regeneration and repair. Curcuma longa is a flowering plant of the zingiberaceae family, and its active ingredient curcumin has multiple functional properties such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, and antioxidant activities. Glycyrrhiza glabra is one of the commonly used medicinal plants, possessing the effects of clearing heat and detoxifying, tonifying the spleen and benefiting qi, nourishing the lungs, and resolving phlegm. Its main active ingredients include triterpenoid saponins, flavonoids, and polysaccharides, which exhibit various pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, immunoregulatory, antiviral, and anti-tumor activities. At the human population level, there is currently no research on the combined intervention of cynara scolymus, silybum marianum, curcuma longa, and glycyrrhiza glabra in patients with MAFLD.\n\nTherefore, this study intends to conduct a randomized controlled double-blind trial to explore the effects of the combined application of cynara scolymus, silybum marianum, curcuma longa, and glycyrrhiza glabra on liver function, liver fat content, glucose and lipid metabolism, and other aspects in patients with MAFLD, in order to clarify the health improvement effects of this combined intervention in patients with MAFLD and provide population-based evidence and strategies for health promotion in this patient group.",

Investigators are doing this by testing for markers in the blood (autoantibodies) that tell them an individuals risk of getting T1D in the future.\n\nWhat is Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)? T1D is a serious disease where the blood glucose (sugar) level is too high because the body cannot make a hormone called insulin.\n\nThis happens when the body's immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin (called beta cells), meaning that insulin production stops.\n\nThis is harmful to the body as insulin does an essential job. It allows the glucose in the blood to enter cells and fuel the body, resulting in a lowering of the blood glucose level.\n\nWhat are Autoantibodies? T1D autoantibodies are markers found in the blood that indicate that the destruction of insulin producing cells has begun. The risk of developing T1D increases with the number of autoantibodies detected.\n\nPeople who have 1 autoantibody detected in their blood are at increased risk of developing T1D. The presence of 2 or more autoantibodies indicates that T1D is present but the individual does not show any signs or symptoms yet.\n\nHowever, these autoantibodies can be present for many years before someone develops symptoms of T1D. They often appear in the first few years of life.\n\nThe investigators are asking children and adults across Europe, aged between 1 and 45 years, who have either a family member (parent, child, full or half sibling) or close friend diagnosed with T1D before 45 years of age to provided a small blood sample so they can look at these T1D autoantibodies.\n\nIf a participant's autoantibody results are negative, this means they do not have autoantibodies and are at low risk of developing T1D. No further tests will be required, and they will exit the program.\n\nIf results indicate a participant has 1 or more positive T1D autoantibodies, a member of the clinical team will contact and invite them to the hospital for a venous blood sample to confirm the result. This confirmation test will be done as part of routine clinical care by the participants clinical team. INNODIA DETECT will end here and, if confirmed positive, the participant will be invited to attend further follow-up by entering in a separate protocol (named INNODIA MONITOR).",

This study aims to analyze the interaction of polymorphisms in the ADRB2 and FTO genes and the DASH diet on anthropometric indicators and laboratory tests in patients with metabolic syndrome in the city of Rio de Janeiro. For this purpose, laboratory tests and anthropometric data will be collected in a prospective study with women aged between 40 and 60 years.",

The diets will be previously calculated, varying from 100 to 100 kcal (1400 to 2600 kcal) based on the patients' total energy value (TEV). The isocaloric, balanced, and individualized diet will be calculated according to the resting metabolic rate (RMR) obtained by the prediction equation and multiplied by the corresponding activity factor to obtain the TEV. The DASH eating plan will consist of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. White meat will be prioritized over red meat, seeds and oilseeds will be included, and sweets and foods rich in sodium will be limited.\n\nDietary assessment will be performed using periodic dietary record forms (24-hour records) for three non-consecutive days, two typical days, and one atypical day, to analyze the participants' eating habits before the dietary intervention. The participants will complete periodic records at seven points before the intervention begins at t15, t30, t45, t60, t75, and at the end of the 90-day study. The nutritionist will review all forms to check for any missing information (number of meals, added sugar, spoon size, quantity consumed, and type of preparation) and notes that could raise questions later (few items recorded, unknown foods, errors in household measurements, and absence of any meal).",

The primary aim of this cohort is to characterize the continuous blood glucose response to dietary intake and physical activity among pregnant women with GDM over 2 weeks, and to facilitate the development of personalized nutritional/lifestyle recommendation among these patients. Another aim of the WGDC is to investigate the association of dietary and physical activity together with continuous glucose change during pregnancy on the adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth, macrosomia and large-for-gestational-age birth. The secondary aim is to investigate the prospective associations of diet, physical activity and continuous glucose change over 2 weeks among the patients with long-term metabolic health of the women and their offspring.",
    "detailed_description": "In China, an alarming increase in the prevalence of GDM has been observed in the past decade. GDM is of concern because it is associated with several maternal and fetal medical disorders. Lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity modifications are key for the prevention and treatment of GDM. However, the associations between dietary intake and physical activity and health outcomes for GDM women and their children remain unclear due to subjective measurements of diet and physical activity. Recently, the development of objective measurements such as food image identification and wearable activity trackers give an opportunity to gain more precise insight into these associations. In addition, for the same food and physical activity exposure, GDM women may have different blood glucose responses, but the nature of variation is currently poorly characterized. Therefore, the present WGDC design incorporates three unique components, 1) objective measurement of physical activity during pregnancy using accelerometer; 2) measurement of dietary intake using both Food Frequency Questionnaire and daily dietary records; 3) measurement of blood glucose levels over 2 weeks using continuous glucose monitors, with three standardized test meals during the 2 weeks. We will then follow up these women participants during and after this pregnancy, and also follow up their offspring.",

    "brief_summary": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by an autoimmune response leading to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The disease association with particular HLA class II alleles, particularly HLA-DQ8, indicates the implication of CD4 T cells in its aetiology. The hypothesis is therefore that T1D starts by the loss of tolerance in autoreactive CD4 T cells. This might result from alterations in conventional autoreactive CD4 T cells (Tcons), which drive disease, or autoreactive regulatory CD4 T cells expressing the transcription factor FOXP3 (Tregs), which normally maintain immune tolerance. The investigators expect that the characterization of HLA-DQ8-restricted Tcons and Tregs in recent onset HLA-DQ8+ T1D patients shall shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning T1D development. This knowledge will guide the development of novel cell therapies harnessing the power of genetically engineered Tregs expressing the relevant antigen receptor to restore immune homeostasis upon cell transfer. The ultimate goal is to reach a curative effect",
    "detailed_description": "During the development of type 1 diabetes (T1DM), regulatory T cells (Treg) are modified and their protective role is no longer optimal, particularly against pathology-specific autoreactive antigens. The hypothesis is that in patients with T1DM, the function and phenotype of Treg cells, as well as their receptor repertoire for the antigen to which they are specific (TCR), no longer allow them to control tolerance. The in-depth study of these cells, at both genetic and molecular levels, will enable a major breakthrough in our understanding of the pathophysiology of T1DM, and in the development of targeted cell therapy.\n\nThe investigators expect major/important differences between patient Tregs and those of the control population in this study, at the molecular, phenotypic and functional levels. These differences will highlight the TCRs recognizing the target self-antigens. In this way, investigators expect to be able to select a limited number of Treg TCRs that could ultimately be used in cell therapy to restore the protective role of Tregs in these patients.\n\nThus, this knowledge will enable to propose in the future a more effective immunotherapy with a long-term effect, in order to improve the management of patients with autoimmune diabetes and potentially cure them.\n\nAccordingly, yhe investigators will study insulin-specific Tregs in T1DM patients and control individuals, as well as conventional T cells directed against the same antigen, which in patients are implicated in the disease. This will include a study of their functional status, their transcriptomic profile, as well as their TCRs and their fine recognition properties of the major diabetes self-antigen, insulin.",

    "detailed_description": "The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education (MBDE) versus standard Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) in adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate-severe diabetes distress who receive their care from safety-net healthcare systems. The goal of this pilot RCT will be to assess the acceptability and feasibility of MBDE; acceptability will be assessed through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants and feasibility will be assessed through process measures. The investigators will recruit up to approximately 96 participants, 48 from each site to account for potential loss to follow up of up to 20%, for the study with total study duration of 6 months. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to each study arm. This study will also serve as a pilot test for the procedures of the RCT and of measures to be used in participant assessments.\n\nThe study will be conducted at two safety-net clinics that provide care for residents of Jefferson County using a sliding scale program based on income level - Cooper Green Mercy Health Services Authority (CGMHSA) and Alabama Regional Medicine Services (ARMS). CGMHSA, an affiliate of University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Health System, is Jefferson County's public safety-net health care facility. CGMHSA provides care primarily to the indigent county residents, geographically spanning most of the Birmingham metropolitan area. Ambulatory care services are provided to patients who have type 2 diabetes through Cooper Green's Primary Care Clinic and multi-disciplinary Diabetes Clinic. ARMS is a Community Health Center serving the greater Birmingham area since 1983. ARMS provides ambulatory care for adults, including primary care, diabetes self-management education classes, and behavioral health services. ARMS offers services to patients, with or without insurance, on a sliding scale fee program based on income.\n\nTrained study staff overseen by the study PI will recruit participants from CGMHSA and ARMS through three methods. Opt-out letters will be mailed to patients seen at CGMHSA or ARMS in the preceding three years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; study staff will then call potential participants to provide more information about the study and to gauge their interest in participating. The investigators will obtain a HIPAA waiver to access potential participant information from the medical record in order to generate a recruitment list. The investigators will also conduct in-person recruitment of participants at CGMHSA and ARMS, as well as direct referral of potential participants by providers or patients. Trained study personnel will obtain screening consent from potential participants prior to screening for eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, which will include assessment of diabetes distress and hemoglobin A1c (A1C) through point-of-care (POC) finger-stick sample. Study staff will then obtain informed consent from eligible participants at the time of enrollment.\n\nBoth MDBE and standard DSME study arms will be delivered in-person, in a group setting with 10-14 participants per group. MBDE will be delivered in 8 weekly group sessions followed by 2 bimonthly individual, booster sessions conducted by phone for a total duration of 6 months. MBDE will be delivered by an interventionist with a background in nursing and training as an MBSR instructor, who will receive additional training in MBDE with an emphasis on content drawn from DSME. Standard DSME will be delivered by a certified diabetes educator in eight weekly sessions of 2 hours duration. Sessions will cover seven core content areas - healthy eating, physical activity, medication usage, self-monitoring, preventing and treating acute and chronic complications, healthy coping, and problem solving.\n\nTotal study duration will be six months; a trained study staff will complete assessments of participants in both study arms at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months. Participants in both study arms will complete assessments that will be conducted by trained study personnel, including interviewer-administered questionnaire, biometric assessment (height, weight, blood pressure), and POC A1C testing from a finger-stick sample at 3 time points - baseline, 2 months, and 6 months. Participants in the MBDE arm will be asked to participate in a focus group (estimated length 1 hour) at the 2 month time point. Participants will receive an incentive for their participation for each study assessment and for participation in a focus group.",

    "brief_summary": "Prolactin is a multifunctional hormone which acts in different cell types rather than just modulating reproduction and lactation. One additional point is its action on glucose metabolism which is described especially in rodents. Prolactin affects proliferation, survival and insulin production of pancreatic beta cells in animal models. But also in human studies prolactin is linked to insulin action. Low systemic levels of prolactin are associated with increased prevalence of diabetes and while higher levels are associated with higher insulin sensitivity.\n\nAcute metabolic effects of prolactin in young, healthy and non-lactating women should be accessed. Therefore, the induction of a transient increase of circulating prolactin levels is necessary to study the acute effects of this hormone on metabolic processes. This can most likely be achieved in non-pregnant and non-lactating women without pharmacological intervention.\n\nAs the main stimulus of prolactin release from the pituitary gland is the mechanical stimulation of the breast / nipple, like a suckling baby, stimulation by a breast pump might trigger prolactin release.\n\nDue to other studies in this field, only a minority of women respond to breast stimulation with an increase in prolactin levels. Therefore, this pilot study will assess if an electric milk pump can stimulate prolactin release in non-lactating women. The second aim of the study is to identify factors which determine response and non-response to breast stimulation.\n\nProlactin will be measured in blood serum. The primary objective of this study is to identify women in whom a 30-minute breast stimulation causes a marked prolactin release. Response is defined as an increase at least twice the baseline value.\n\nSecond outcomes are the quantification and duration of prolactin increase as well as to detect differences in responders and non-responders. Therefore, demographic data as well as anthropometric data will also be assessed. A 10-minute electrocardiography and non-invasive measurement of resting energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry will also be performed. History of menstrual cycle, intake of contraceptive, parity and lactation experience will be recorded. Physical activity level and feeling of hunger will be assessed by questionnaires.\n\nFeeling of hunger, resting energy expenditure, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature will be assessed repeatedly to register differences before and after stimulation. Blood and urine samples will be assessed for safety.",

They also showed that low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by NCDs, accounting for 85% of NCD-related deaths among individuals aged 30-69 y. Among NCDs, CVD is the leading and fourth-leading causes of death, accounting for 19.5 million deaths worldwide in 2018. Furthermore, despite increasing global awareness, the prevalence of these conditions continues to increase at alarming rates. Deaths from CVD are expected to reach 23.6 million annually by 2030 from 17.6 million deaths in 2016. The underlying aetiology of these conditions is complex, as they can be influenced by several environmental, genetic, and behavioural factors. However, diet and nutrition play a particularly important role in these conditions, especially in the context of the double burden of malnutrition facing many low- and middle-income countries.",
    "detailed_description": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), one of the intriguing features of traditional Chinese culture, has a history of more than 2,000 years, with both unique theories and rich experience. Because of the lack of objective and quantitative evaluation criteria, TCM is complementary or alternative medicine in most Western countries. However, in China, more than 71.2% of patients who have experienced Western medicine, TCM, and integrative medicine (both Western medicine and TCM) preferred the integrative approach, and 18.7% chose TCM as their favourite. Moreover, TCM is increasingly welcomed in many developed countries, such as Australia and the United States. Importantly, patients who used more types of TCM tended to use much less Western medicine recommended by current guidelines. Recent review also highlighted the potential use of TCM as a complementary and alternative approach to the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Perfect Heartio (PH) is a nutritional drink composed of mainly diluted herbal extracts of TCM, including ginger, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Alternanthera sessilis, Panax notoginseng, red date, Codonopsis pilosula, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Astragalus membranaceus. Broad pharmacological properties of ginger and its bioactive components have been reported, suggesting its potential use in preventing CVD. Glycyrrhiza uralensis stands out for its exceptional therapeutic potential, particularly in enhancing cardiac muscle regeneration, and slowing muscle aging. Alternanthera sessilis has been showed to prevent cardiovascular and liver diseases. Panax notoginseng improve angiogenesis. Red date exerts anti-adipogenicity effects and enhancing endothelial function. Codonopsis pilosula improves the functional state of the cardiovascular system and mitigating the onset and progression of CVD. Ligusticum chuanxiong has been showed to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis.

Thus, the results of the DREAM-ON study could inform future clinical practice guidelines for the management AP as well as potentially extending the licensing authorization for CGM to include use in patients with pancreatogenic (Type 3c) DM.",
    "detailed_description": "The primary objective of the DREAM-ON study is to determine if continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics can predict the incidence of prediabetes mellitus (PDM) and diabetes mellitus (DM) after an episode of acute pancreatitis (AP). Secondary objectives of the DREAM-ON study include determining if CGM metrics predict the need for insulin therapy in participants who develop diabetes mellitus after AP, and if CGM metrics correlate with measures of insulin secretion and insulin resistance.\n\nThe specific aims of the DREAM-ON study are as follows:\n\nAim 1: To test whether standard CGM metrics predict incident DM. The investigators will perform blinded CGM in DREAM-ON participants at their scheduled visits at months 3, 12, 24 and subsequent annual visits. The investigators will test whether standard CGM metrics (mean glucose, time in tight range 70-140, time in range 70-180, time above 180 mg/dL, time above 250 mg/dL and glucose CV) predict incident DM determined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and clinical report.\n\nAim 2: To test whether CGM metrics predict need for insulin therapy in patients who develop DM after AP. From blinded CGM, we will test whether standard CGM metrics (mean glucose, time in tight range 70-140, time in range 70-180, time above 180 mg/dL, time above 250 mg/dL and glucose CV) as well as other indices of glucose variability, including mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), predict need for long-term insulin therapy.\n\nAim 3: To determine whether CGM metrics correlate with measures of insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The investigators will test whether standard and advanced CGM metrics correlate with measures of insulin secretion and insulin resistance derived from the OGTT, the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT) and the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT). The investigators also will test whether these metrics can be used as a surrogate to predict diabetes subtype (i.e., insulin deficient vs. insulin resistant).",

    "brief_summary": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities and underserved populations in Philadelphia. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced community health worker (CHW) program that combines the evidence-based DECIDE self-management intervention with structured CHW consultations to improve CVD self-management skills and address social needs. Using a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Design, we will recruit 500 Philadelphia residents aged 35-75 with CVD risk factors and unmet social needs. Participants will be offered the DECIDE+ intervention (9 bi-weekly group sessions plus alternating CHW consultations) or continue with standard CHW services. The primary outcome is CVD self-management skills measured by the Self-care of Chronic Illness Inventory Maintenance scale. Secondary outcomes include health behaviors and resolution of social needs. Implementation outcomes will assess CHW experiences, community advisory council impact, and factors influencing participation. Propensity score methods will be used to compare changes in outcomes between DECIDE+ participants and those receiving standard CHW services. Mediation analyses will examine pathways through problem-solving skills, self-efficacy, and social needs resolution. Mixed methods will evaluate implementation outcomes. This study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of integrating an evidence-based self-management program with CHW services to address both clinical and social needs.\n\nThis study has the potential to generate important and impactful findings that can advance health equity and the science of effective community health worker programs. By rigorously evaluating the real-world implementation of a city-wide CHW-delivered chronic disease self-management program that also addresses collaborative approaches and support to addressing social needs, our findings can provide a roadmap for other communities looking to implement evidence-based interventions to reduce health disparities. Demonstrating improved CVD self-management behaviors and reduced social needs among Philadelphia residents receiving the DECIDE+ intervention would provide compelling evidence for the synergistic benefit of these services, and to sustain and scale up this model.\n\nOBJECTIVES: We propose both effectiveness and implementation questions to guide our work:\n\nEffectiveness of CHW Engagement:\n\n1. Is the DECIDE intervention with CHW consultations (DECIDE+) effective in improving CVD self-management skills compared to the standard and limited CHW engagement?\n\n   1. Do DECIDE+ sessions improve CVD self-management skills by strengthening problem solving and self-efficacy?\n   2. Does participation in CHW consultations improve CVD self-management skills by meeting social needs?\n\n   Implementation Questions:\n2. What key sociodemographic and psychosocial factors influence client participation in the study?\n3. How do CHWs perceive the impact of facilitator training on their a.) knowledge, attitudes and practices in supporting clients b.) personal health management, and c.) job satisfaction?\n4. How does the CAC facilitate resource mobilization to enhance access to services that address social needs in Philadelphia's communities?",
    "detailed_description": "The American Heart Association estimates that a person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD remains a leading cause of mortality in the US. Even people with just one risk factor for CVD (e.g. hypertension) have an estimated 30% lifetime risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event (e.g. heart attack); this risk increases to 70% among people with 2 or more risk factors. Therefore, there remains an urgent need to improve cardiovascular health behaviors and decrease risk for CVD particularly among racial/ethnic minoritized populations who are disproportionately affected by CVD and associated risk factors. Compared to Non-Latino Whites, Blacks experience higher rates of CVD risk factors - particularly obesity and hypertension - and are more likely to die from CVD. Similarly, higher prevalence and mortality of ischemic heart disease are noted in some Asian-American subgroups when compared to non-Latino Whites. Although, Latinos do not experience higher rates of CVD mortality compared to non-Latino Whites, Latinos are experiencing increasing rates of stroke and heart-failure related mortality. For those with CVD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, optimal management of these conditions can improve quality of life and reduce risk for premature mortality. Despite bordering the healthiest county in Pennsylvania, Philadelphia is the least healthy county in Pennsylvania and one of the least healthy in the nation. Compared to higher ranked counties in Pennsylvania, Philadelphians report less cardiovascular health behaviors (e.g. less physical activity, more smoking).\n\nChronic disease self-management (CDSM) is an evidence-based approach for chronic disease control, reducing health care utilization, and improving quality of life at the individual level. CDSM refers to a set of ongoing processes to proactively manage one's health condition(s). These processes can be categorized as - 1) disease/condition specific knowledge, 2) self-regulation skills including problem-solving, action planning, and effective coping, and 3) engaging social support. DECIDE (Decision-making Education for Choices in Diabetes Everyday) is a 9-session self-management program delivered bi-weekly for 90-minutes that offers disease specific education and problem-solving training for behavior change and optimal chronic disease management. DECIDE was originally developed for African Americans with diabetes and low-literacy, and has been modified for other populations and for other cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. However, for programs like DECIDE to be effective they must be accessible to the target population, and people need supportive environments (e.g. stable housing) to realize optimal chronic disease management.\n\nCommunity health workers (CHWs) are an essential community-level resource for the implementation and sustainability of self-management programs for under-resourced, racial/ethnic minoritized populations. For many underserved populations, SDoH inequities (e.g. neighborhood deprivation, access to health insurance) impede consistent CDSM. SDoH are determined by macro-level factors (e.g. organizational and civic systems and policies) that influence individual level social needs such as food and housing security. A key element of CHW effectiveness for promoting self-management among community members is their ability to provide ongoing support and advocacy for navigating the complex social determinants of health to address individual social needs. There is compelling evidence demonstrating the benefit and cost-effectiveness of CHW services for promoting CDSM and improving health outcome. Specifically in Philadelphia, CHW support for addressing social needs and helping with health system navigation has reduced all cause hospitalization and hospital stay among a low-income and high-risk for CVD population.\n\nRecognizing the reciprocal determinism between individuals, their environment, and their behaviors, our DECIDE+ intervention integrates components to enhance CVD self-management. At the individual level, we will offer the DECIDE intervention as a group-based program. This program, facilitated by CHWs, will emphasize the importance of observational learning and group support to strengthen their CVD problem solving. Consistent with the DECIDE intervention's existing evidence-base, CVD problem solving is hypothesized to strengthen an individual's CVD self-management self-efficacy and skills, respectively. Increased self-management self-efficacy and skills are posited to increase the adoption of CVD-related health promotive behaviors.\n\nAt the community level, we also recognize that individuals' social environment may deter individuals' willingness and/or ability to engage in CVD-related health promotive behaviors if they have more pressing social needs requiring attention. Therefore, we propose to supplement the DECIDE intervention with biweekly one on one consultations with CHWs to address their environmental and situational barriers. By offering continued engagement with CHWs, we expect that participants will have greater success in meeting their social needs. As noted above, our CAC will support these efforts by identifying solutions and leveraging community resources that may further address participants' environmental and situational barriers. Ultimately, we posit that participants who have their social needs met will be more likely to engage in CVD-related self-management skills and health promotive behaviors.",

The two arms are (1) intervention group with culturally-tailored portion-control Mediterranean Diet-like advice through monthly individual counseling for 12 months, reinforced with daily text messages for 12 months, and a monthly household supply of legumes, vegetable oils, and locally sourced assorted fruit and vegetables for 18 months; (2) control arm with portion-control standard non-tailored nutritional counseling in monthly individual sessions for 12 months, reinforced with daily text messages for 12 months, and monthly assistance to purchase healthy foods for 18 months. From months 18-24, we will monitor behavior maintenance (no food/voucher or counseling), with support from the nutritionist, and cues-to-action texts. Investigators will measure changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and metrics of eating behaviors and psychological factors. The two co-primary outcomes are changes in ASCVD score and cardiometabolic improvement score.",

Pregnant individuals with GDM have higher rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, and maternal mortality as compared to those without GDM. While GDM frequently resolves after delivery, up to 70% of patients will develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life10 and one third will develop subsequent diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism at the time of postpartum screening.\n\nWhile postpartum screening is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) between 4-12 weeks postpartum for all patients with GDM in pregnancy, nearly 40% of patients do not attend a postpartum visit. Attendance is even lower among populations with limited resources, contributing to health disparities.\n\nTo address this issue, immediate in-hospital postpartum glucose tolerance testing has been evaluated and found to yield diagnostic values comparable to postpartum screening with the advantage of \\~100% adherence. However, 2 challenges remain: currently there is a lack of widespread clinical implementation of in-hospital immediate postpartum diabetes screening.\n\nTherefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to randomize patients to early screening during their postpartum hospitalization versus at their 6 week postpartum visit (current standard of care).",

    "brief_summary": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects around 200,000 people in France. The only treatment is insulin, administered either by multiple injections, by pump alone or, more recently, by automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs), which have resulted in a very significant improvement in glycaemic control and quality of life. These closed-loop (CL) devices are capable of effectively regulating the conventional factors associated with glycaemic disturbance, namely dietary intake and physical activity. However, they do not account of stress, which some subjects with T1D perceive as a major disrupter of their blood sugar levels. One of the reasons for this is undoubtedly that stress, unlike diet or physical activity, cannot be anticipated. Since stress is difficult to predict, it is also more difficult to study. Its onset, intensity, duration and progression are linked to the subject's experience, psychological state and environment. Not all patients respond to stress triggers in the same way. Some patients appear to be more reactive than others to these agents, particularly when they are exposed to them chronically or repeatedly, in an anxiety-provoking environment. This is known as chronic psychosocial stress, and it is this type of stress that seems to be most closely associated with glycaemic disturbance in subjects with T1D, most often in the form of hyperglycaemia and, more rarely, hypoglycaemia. However, there are no solid epidemiological or experimental data to support these observations.\n\nThe study we propose is a prospective multicentre clinical trial in 125 subjects with T1D treated with insulin pumps or multi-injections at 14 French university centres. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between interstitial glucose levels measured by CGM and perceived stress, assessed 4 times a day, away from mealtimes in order to avoid the impact of dietary glycaemia, using a \"stressometer\". This stressometer is an application designed by CERITD that can be downloaded to the patient's smartphone and consists of an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) on which the level of stress felt is evaluated quantitatively (continuous value between 0 and 10).",

However, optimization of CR is necessary. Current CR programs pay insufficient attention to sleep and stress problems, despite more than 50% of CVD patients experiencing sleep problems and high stress levels. Both sleep and stress are associated with adverse cardiovascular health and a decreased quality of life. The hypothesis for this study is that adding a behavioural intervention will improve sleep and perceived stress (primary outcomes), along with positive outcomes on biomarkers of chronic stress, QoL, cardiometabolic risk factors, physical fitness, lifestyle components, and psychosocial well-being.\n\nThe project involves a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The intervention group (100 patients) will receive standard CR along with the RESST intervention, consisting of 5-6 on-site group sessions integrating principles from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and focused on improving sleep and stress. The control group (100 patients) will receive standard multidisciplinary CR only.\n\nThe primary outcomes of the study include both objective and subjective measures of sleep, as well as perceived stress. Secondary outcomes encompass quality of life, chronic stress biomarkers, cardiometabolic risk factors, physical fitness, lifestyle components and psychosocial wellbeing. These outcomes will be assessed before and after the intervention, as well as at a 6-month follow-up.",

    "brief_summary": "Links between sleep and food intake are manyfold. In healthy individuals, sleep deprivation promotes obesity by stimulating food intake of high glycemic index (GI) foods. Conversely, high GI foods induce sleepiness. Obesity is observed in 30-50% of patients with Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). Its determinism may involve transient changes in basal metabolism at the early stage of the disease, eating disorders, disrupted nighttime sleep and sleepiness. In contrast, patients suffering from idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), whose nocturnal sleep is generally long and of good quality, rarely present with obesity. By studying the relationships between diet, body composition and sleep patterns in these two populations and in healthy controls, the NARCOFOOD study aims to provide a better understanding of the determinants of obesity in narcolepsy and, more generally, of the effects of food intake on sleepiness.\n\nPatients will be recruited at the Lyon and Clermont-Ferrand sleep centers and Controls at the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center. Data from clinical evaluation (including body mass index and body composition), and questionnaires (sleep quality, insomnia, sleepiness, anxiety and depression, impulsivity, eating behaviors) will be collected. During 4 days, at home, the following parameters will be explored : 1) eating behaviors (meals' photos) and sugar consumption (FreeStylePro sensor measuring interstitial glucose) 2) sleep/wake rhythm (diary and actigraphy) 3) nocturnal sleep parameters (Somfit device) 4) sleepiness (Karolinska sleepiness scale and EEG markers of sleepiness with the Somfit device) before and after meals.\n\nThe hypothesis is that increased sleepiness would favor food intake of high GI foods, which would worsen sleepiness in all 3 groups, with a more pronounced effect in NT1. Compared to IH patients and controls, NT1 patients may present more snacking of high GI foods, especially at night if sleep is disrupted, and this would be correlated with body composition.\n\nThe findings will help to better understand the mechanisms of obesity in narcolepsy and may lay the ground for the development of new therapeutic strategies in disorders of hypersomnolence, targeting dietary behaviors.",

Study Design and Participants The sample of this randomised controlled clinical trial will consist of adult individuals with Type 2 diabetes who apply to Erzurum City Hospital Internal Medicine outpatient clinic. A control group will be formed with individuals with Type 2 diabetes in the same age group. Informed Voluntary Consent Form will be obtained from the individuals before starting the study. Power analysis was performed to determine the sample size. The study population was determined as 70 individuals with the G-power programme. In this randomised controlled study, individuals will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups using a computer generated list.\n2. Intervention and Control Groups Individuals who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The study consists of three stages. The first interview will take place at week 0, the second interview at week 6 and the last interview at week 12. The control group will not be intervened by not giving any additional food and will be asked not to consume dates during the study. The intervention group will be informed at the first interview about which meal and in what quantity they will consume dates. Dates will be delivered to participants at baseline (6-week supply) and at week 6 of the study (6-week supply). Individuals in the intervention group will consume 3 (25 g) Baghdad dates (15 g CHO) daily as part of the breakfast meal. Individuals will be given weekly recording sheets to record their date consumption. The diaries will be collected fortnightly to ensure dates are consumed as directed (a photo of the diary will be requested via email or social media). Individuals will receive a fortnightly telephone reminder.\n3. Questionnaire Form Information such as socio-demographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption status, health status, medication used in diabetes treatment, etc. will be obtained through a face-to-face questionnaire. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used for subjective hunger. The questionnaire form will also include the Food Power Scale for the assessment of hedonic hunger, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF) for the assessment of physical activity levels and three-day Food Consumption Records for the assessment of food consumption.\n4. Anthropometric Measurements In the study, anthropometric measurements of individuals will be taken at 0. 6. and 12. weeks. Height will be measured with a stadiometer (SECA 213) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm with the feet side by side and the head in the Frankort plane. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (TanitaBC-730) will be used to evaluate body weight and body composition. The measurements will be performed by the researcher.\n5. Biochemical analyses Blood samples taken from the individuals at weeks 0 and 12 will be analysed in the Biochemistry Laboratory of Atat\u00fcrk University Research Hospital. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, Ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride analyses will be performed. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are the tests routinely requested by the doctor. Blood samples for ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP analyses will be collected and analysed separately in the laboratory. Fasting blood glucose and insulin values of individuals who will be used in homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose will be measured with a glucometer at 0, 6 and 12 weeks of the study.\n\n   * Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 22 software.",

    "brief_summary": "Gestational diabetes (GDM) develops during pregnancy and is becoming increasingly common. The condition is associated with adverse outcomes for mother and baby during both the pregnancy and delivery period. This study compares glucose variability (recorded by a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor) in pregnant women who have been diagnosed with GDM with pregnant woman who do not have the diagnosis but are at high risk. The sensors will be applied to 400 participants around the time of their standard test for GDM, with a randomly selected 60 of these patients forming a sub-group later in the study to assess for progression of high blood glucose. At present, a positive oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is used to confirm the diagnosis of GDM but the test can be unreliable leading to potential diagnostic error. CGM devices are used extensively in the management of Type 1 diabetes and GDM, and have also shown potential to be used in the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIf this study can demonstrate similar trends in glucose variability between OGTT positive patients and those who are OGTT negative but are at high risk for the condition, then further research into the utility of CGM as a diagnostic alternative or supplement to the OGTT would be indicated.\n\nThe investigators will recruit 400 patients at high risk for GDM, give them a blinded CGM device, and compare the CGM glucose data with their OGTT result, their initial risk factors for GDM, their pregnancy outcome and their need for treatment. The investigators will use the data to test our hypothesis that a positive OGTT result does not predict hyperglycaemia in pregnancy.",
    "detailed_description": "Gestational Diabetes (GDM) is associated with higher than normal blood sugar levels in pregnant women which has the potential to harm the baby and mother. The condition resolves with delivery of the baby, but during the pregnancy there is a limited time window for diagnosis and treatment before harm may be caused.\n\nGDM is thought to affect up to 32% of pregnancies and is becoming more common due to rising rates of obesity and maternal age. The current recommended practice in the UK for the diagnosis of GDM is to use the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is two plasma blood glucose tests (one at baseline and one 2 hours after a glucose load) performed on expectant mothers who have at least one risk factor for GDM at 28 weeks gestation. This method is not standard internationally, with some countries using the test on all woman who fall pregnant, others adhering to different diagnostic thresholds, and others performing the test in a different way. Furthermore, there is no international consensus on the best way to diagnoses GDM. The challenge in diagnosing the condition arises because the results of the OGTT relies upon only two glucose measurements and therefore are not always accurate, meaning that some expectant mothers with GDM are missed, and others who do not have GDM are incorrectly told they have the condition.\n\nPregnant women who develop GDM but are not identified by the OGTT may suffer complications which could have been avoided with glucose lowering therapy, whilst woman who are incorrectly diagnosed with the condition may have their pregnancies unnecessarily medicalised, both of which places extra burden on the healthcare system. Therefore, improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of GDM has the potential to improve outcomes in pregnancies worldwide (and significantly impact upon current practice).\n\nRecent technological advances in the field of diabetes care have seen the emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) - digital sensors placed on a patient's skin which constantly read the blood sugar level and communicate with their smart phone. Data from the CGM sensor is sent via Bluetooth to the smart phone, and using software downloaded in an app, is converted into a graphical summary illustration called an 'ambulatory glucose profile' (AGP) allowing for better treatment decisions to be made.\n\nCGM devices are revolutionising the monitoring and treatment of diabetes, including GDM, however they are not utilised for diagnostic purposes. This study examines the challenging task of accurately diagnosing GDM by comparing the CGM data of patients with GDM with the CGM data of individuals at high risk of GDM (who are OGTT negative) to determine if the OGTT result is predictive of high blood glucose.\n\nThe glucose data from CGM devices in woman who test positive on the OGTT will be compared with women who are high risk for GDM but test negative, whilst also correlating with pregnancy outcomes such as need for treatment or complications. The study aims to test the hypothesis that a positive OGTT may not predict hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. If the hypothesis is proven correct, it may suggest that CGM/AGP has the potential to improve the current methodology of testing for GDM and that further studies examining this would be recommended.\n\nThe study will be undertaken in the Academic department of Diabetes and Endocrinology and the Joint diabetes antenatal clinic at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS trust. Participants will be pregnant women who have been identified according to established NICE criteria as being suitable for screening for GDM. Woman with any of the following risk factors are offered a screening test (OGTT) for GDM as per standard NHS care: BMI above 30kg/m\u00b2, previous macrosomic baby weighing 4.5kg or more, previous GDM, family history of diabetes (first-degree relative with diabetes), an ethnicity with a high prevalence of diabetes. Patients with the risk factor 'previous GDM' will be excluded from the study as this prior diagnosis may influence behaviour in the current pregnancy. The risk assessment is undertaken during their booking appointment at 12 weeks gestation.\n\nParticipants will be identified using the hospital's electronic maternity records system, contacted at the earliest opportunity and given the participant information sheet (PIS). Patients will be given sufficient time to read the PIS (at least 24 hours) after which eligibility criteria will be checked and informed consent taken. This will take place during 12-26 weeks gestation. All participants will continue to receive antenatal care. The investigators will recruit 400 participants onto the study.\n\nStudy visit 1: (26-27 weeks gestation) This will be an in person visit at our site which is in addition to standard antenatal care. This is the only visit that is additional to standard NHS care for the majority of the study cohort. The study process will be discussed in full and any questions answered. A CGM device (freestyle Libre sensor) will be applied to the patient. It collects data automatically and is blinded.\n\nStudy visit 2: (28 weeks Gestation - OGTT date) When the participants attend for their OGTT they will have further opportunity to interact with the study team (all of whom are involved in the routine delivery of NHS maternity diabetes care) and any issues will be addressed. Their CGM devices will be removed at the end of the data capture period. The data from their OGTT test will be compared with their CGM data.\n\nSub-Group Study visit 3: 32 weeks gestation Of the 400 patients, 60 will be randomly selected (to include 30 OGTT positive and 30 OGTT negative patients) to form a sub-group. Patients in this sub-group will be invited prior to their standard NHS 32 week maternity visit to receive a further CGM device which will be applied on the day of the visit. The sub-group analysis is to assess for progression of glycaemia in both OGTT positive and negative groups.\n\nFurther study visits (up until end of gestation) Participants who tested positive on their OGTT are diagnosed with GDM and are usually followed up fortnightly in the JDANC clinic as part of routine NHS care. The study team will use information from these visits to inform the previously stated secondary objectives.\n\nFollow up:\n\nPatients will not be required to fill in questionnaires or attend further study visits in the follow up period. Electronic data will be collected on birth outcome; including mode of delivery, birth weight, premature delivery, any adverse fetal outcomes or neonatal hypoglycaemia. Data will be collected on the participants' 3 month post-partum HbA1c test that assess for resolution of GDM. This is a routine test that will not be undertaken by the study team but will be easily accessible on the electronic hospital record.",

    "brief_summary": "Carbohydrate counting is an essential component of diabetes management in both adults and children, and together with an intensive insulin plan and increased blood glucose monitoring was associated with lower HbA1c. Carbohydrate counting is perceived as one of the most burdensome tasks in T1D and is frequently done inconsistently and with poor accuracy A recent analysis confirms that MiniMed\u2122 Advaced Hybrid closed loop (AHCL) system is designed for optimal performance with meal announcement. Nonetheless, when meals containing \\< 80 grams of carbohydrates are consumed with announcement of meals at will, there is a slight reduction in the number of daily boluses with no decline in glycemic control, yet markedly less diabetes related distress and improved treatment satisfaction TIR of 78.1% in unannounced meals compared with 78.8% with announced meals .",
    "detailed_description": "We aim to compare glucose control in adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) without carbohydrate counting skills that use simplified meal announcement to those with carbohydrate counting skills with regular meal announcement by carbohydrates, both using MiniMed 780G system.\n\nThis study is observational, two arm, single-center, clinical investigation in subjects with type 1 diabetes on AHCL insulin pump in a period of 3 months, with extension of another 9 months.\n\nA total of 34 individuals (age 12-17 years) will be enrolled to reach 30 individuals who will complete the 3 months study.\n\nParticipants will be assigned in two groups based on score of the Carbohydrate Assessment Tool (appendix):\n\n* Group 1(Flex), Regular Clinical Protocol, 17 participants (Score\\>7)\n* Group 2, (Fix), Simplified Clinical Protocol, 17 participants (Score\\<4) If the score is between 5-6, another training session for carbohydrate counting will be offered to the participants and assessment will be performed again to assign the participant to the each group.\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's eligibility and interest, the investigators will obtain informed consent and assent as appropriate and will start the clinical process for initiating an insulin pump, which is typically done with pre-pump classes. A clinically obtained HbA1c assessment will be performed via fingerstick and DCA 2000 at baseline and 3 months during the study.\n\nCollection of demographics and medical history, data for diabetes devices (eg meters, sensors, pumps) and brief clinical physical exam including vital signs and skin assessment will be obtained via Hospital Electronic Medical File (Cerner Millennium) and will be kept as electronic data on a separate research server.\n\nRecruitment process All patients will be recruited during the regular clinic visits at Endocrine Clinics at Sidra Medicine in Doha. The principal investigator will evaluate if the patient meets the inclusion criteria during the regular clinic visits. Patients will be chosen first-come first-served, until 34 patients are reached. A research assistant will explain the study protocol and give patient and parent information in a confidential environment, where parents and patients will have the opportunity to ask questions about the study. Obtaining the informed consent will be ensured with participant privacy, giving adequate information about the study in a language understandable for potential subject, as well providing adequate opportunity to the subject to consider all options. The principal investigator will stress that this study is on a voluntary basis and there will be no impact on continuity of care for patients who will decide not to participate in this study. They will also be able to take the documents home, to consider their possible inclusion in the study. Parents \\& patients will also be able to discuss any issues or concerns or ask for clarification with the PI before including the child in the study. All subjects' questions and concerns will be answered and will be provided with necessary information. The research team will be assured of subject comprehension of the information provided.\n\nOnce the patient and parent decide to progress to inclusion within the study the research assistant will arrange a meeting for further explanation of the study protocol. Principal investigator will stress again that this study is on voluntary basis and there will be no impact on diabetes care if they decided not to participate in the study. If parents and patients have questions, those will be answered and if they need more time to decide, the research assistant will arrange another meeting. If parents and patients agree to participate in the study, consent/assent will be obtained, as required. Extra time can also be given should parents and patients decide to further consider their inclusion in the study and to sign the required consent/assent forms. Medical history, Medication history, Physical exam with Vital signs, concomitant medication will be also collected at the regular clinic visit Adverse Events in terms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be also considered on this visit and all following visits.\n\nBase line assessment and the following variables checked at baseline:\n\n* Age, yrs\n* Gender\n* Weight, kg\n* Height, cm\n* Duration of diabetes, yrs\n* Therapy (Multiple dily injections +Self monitoring of blood glucsoe, multiple daily injections and glucose sensor, insulin pump or sensor augmented pump)\n* TDD, U/(kg/d)\n* HbA1c, %\n\nQuestionnaire (baseline) will be performed for both participants and parents(caregivers):\n\n* The Diabetes Strengths and Resilience Measure for Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (DSTAR-Teen) (participant)\n* The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (participant)\n* PedsQL Diabetes Module Version 3.0 Child Report (participant)\n* PedsQL Diabetes Module Version 3.0 Parent for Child Report (parent/caregiver)\n\nCarbohydrate assessment tool will be given to participants (appendix) in order to evaluate the carbohydrate counting skills. This tool is already used as standard clinical practice at our department. The tool is based on 7 questions with a total score of 10. There are 3 grades:\n\n* \\<4, no carbohydrate counting skills.\n* 5-6, in between.\n* \\>7, carbohydrate skills. If the score is 5 or 6, another training session will be offered to the participants in order to learn carbohydrate counting, and then the assessment will be performed again to assign the patient into the group.\n\nParticipants will be assigned in two groups based on score of the Carbohydrate Assessment Tool (appendix):\n\nGroup 1(Flex), Regular Clinical Protocol, 17 participants (Score\\>7) Group 2, (Fix), Simplified Clinical Protocol, 17 participants (Score\\<4)\n\nPump School: Visit 2,3 and 4 On the following visits, training on the insulin pump will be delivered to the participants.\n\nAHCL system training. Two to four individuals and their parents/guardians will attend the group training sessions. Each session was provided by diabetes educators from 12pm to 3pm. CGM will be initiated the first day of the training, for education and observational purposes and for baseline data collection (no insulin delivery by the pump).\n\nThe program included five sessions of three hours on three consecutive days: Day 1- pump menus and icons, understanding CGM graph, education in sensor calibration and sensor insertion, MiniMed Mobile App and Carelink Connect application; Day 2- Operational modes and readiness, bolus wizard use, infusion set and reservoir change; Day 3- hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, exercise and travel management, temporary target use; Day 4- manual Mode insulin start \\& final evaluation of participants' ability to handle the advanced hybrid closed loop (HCL) system.\n\nDay 5 - Smartguard start review of manual mode report, changes to pump settings as required smartguard exits and troubleshooting.\n\nTiming of the long-acting insulin injection will be moved two hours ahead each day during training sessions, to reach 12pm the day before the AHCL system initiation as Sensor Augmented Pump (SAP), to avoid the use of temporary basal at insulin pump initiation.\n\nPump school Day 4 Manual Mode Start Participants will initiate the use of the advanced HCL system in Manual Mode with suspend before low feature for 72 hours to allow the algorithm to collect insulin utilization and CGM data to establish personalized Smart Guard Auto Mode initiation parameters. Sidra's validated protocol for SAP initiation, with review of one-week CGM data will be used: in short, the protocol inputs the current insulin program (MDI), calculates a 10 to 20% reduction of total daily dose, with a 40/60 basal/bolus distribution in four or five basal rates. Insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR) settings utilizes the formula of 300-450/Total Daily dose (TDD) and, the formula of 90-110/TDD (mmol/l) with two Correction Factors (CF) settings, the nighttime CF set 10-20% higher than the daytime CF. Active insulin Time (AIT) is set on 3 hours, suspend before low feature is turned on with a threshold of 3.0-3.8 mmol/l (55-70 mg/dl) and glucose target range from 5.0 mmol/l to 7.2 mmol/l (90-130 mg/dl),).\n\nParticipants in both groups will initiate the SAP according to above protocol with finetuning of ICR, Basal Rates, AIT and insulin to sensitifivty factor (ISF), reviewing 7 Days of MDI+CGM data, based on clinical experience.\n\nPump School Day Visit 5 - Smartguard Start\n\nAHCL Initiation and Follow up.

    "brief_summary": "Only 24.9% of the Belgian adults (25-50 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) achieve a good glucose control. This can be explained by the challenging day-to-day diabetes management which places a substantial burden on this population. However, a tight glycemic control is fundamental in order to prevent the development of acute and chronic complications. Despite the added value of continue glucose monitors to glucose control, optimizing daily glucose levels is still problematic in adults with T1DM. In addition to self-monitoring of blood glucose, a healthy lifestyle with sufficient physical activity (PA), limited sedentary behavior (SB) and sufficient sleep time and quality is crucial for a good glucose control. A recent shift in health promotion stresses the importance of considering all these behaviors (i.e. PA, SB and sleep) in one 24-hour day instead of focusing on one behavior in isolation. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the day-by-day 24h-MB patterns of adults (25-50 years) with T1DM and their intra-day glucose control (i.e. time in range and coefficient of variation) on the one hand. On the other hand, associations between he 24-h MB patterns and explanatory variables and cardiometabolic health markers will be investigated. To gain insight into the 24-hour behavior of adults with type 1 diabetes, 150 adults with type 1 diabetes will wear an Actigraph accelerometer, for 14 consecutive days. Daily glucose control will be measured using the participant's continuous glucose meter. Information about the explanatory variables and cardiometabolic health will be obtained by means of a questionnaire, diary and a few measurements (blood pressure, weight, length, Advanced Glycation Endproducts, hip-and waist circumference) during a one-off visit to one of the recruitment- and testing centers namely University hospital of Ghent or University hospital of Antwerp. The results of this cross-sectional study will inform future interventions focusing on the 24-hour movement behaviors in adults with T1DM.",

    "brief_summary": "The hypothesis is that acupuncture is equally effective as metformin (both treatments combined with lifestyle management) in improving whole body glucose homeostasis in insulin resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and that both are superior to lifestyle management alone. The investigators hypothesize that acupuncture and metformin induce ovulation and improve hyperandrogenism, as well as health related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although equally effective (acupuncture and metformin), the investigators hypothesize that acupuncture is associated with less negative side-effects. The investigators also hypothesize that these treatments have the potential to restore epigenetic and molecular alterations in target tissues (endometrial-, adipose-, and skeletal muscle tissue) and thus have the potential to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D).",

To determine the clinical effectiveness of 4 months of 1) electroacupuncture + lifestyle management and 2) metformin + lifestyle management, compared to 3) lifestyle management only, for improvement of insulin sensitivity as measured by HOMA-IR, by the insulin response to glucose assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUCinsulin) during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and by glucose regulation (assessed by analyzing Hba1c levels).\n\nSecondary aims\n\n1. To evaluate changes in secondary metabolic measures, including fasting insulin, c-peptide, glucose, and adipokines, calculation of HOMA-B (i.e. the Islet \u03b2-cell function) and the c-peptide index, assessment of the adipokines and lipid profile, body size and proportions and body fat distribution.\n2. To determine changes in genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles related to insulin sensitivity in fat, muscle and endometrial tissue biopsies, and biomarkers in whole blood.\n3. To evaluate endocrine measures including menstrual pattern and ovulation frequency, circulating hormones (sex steroids, AMH, gonadotropins), and excretion of metabolites of sex steroids in urine.\n4. To determine changes in women's HRQoL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, dieting and eating patterns, and negative side-effects.\n5. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatments.",

    "brief_summary": "Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease worldwide, characterized by hyperglycemia, decreased whole body insulin sensitivity, and white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction. A key factor in its development is chronic overnutrition, usually with a high-fat diet (HFD), leading to disturbances of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the mechanism of short-term HFD-induced tissue-specific insulin resistance remains poorly understood. This project aims to further unravel the underlying mechanisms of short-term HFD overnutrition-mediated WAT insulin resistance. The model described here corresponds to a randomized, single- blinded parallel-grouped trial, consisting of two interventions: a macronutrient-balanced diet and or a hypercaloric diet over three weeks in order to investigate differences in interorgan fatty acid and glucose metabolism between the studied groups. Based on recent studies, the hypothesis is that 21-day hypercaloric HFD induces WAT insulin resistance via a diacylglycerol, novel protein kinase C-insulin receptor signaling model in both fasting and insulin-stimulated states.",

The groups will be compared regarding clinical parameters, patient-centered measures, including remaining wound area, epithelialization, tissue thickness, immature wound area, tissue edema, early wound healing index, postoperative discomfort, quality of life, number of analgesics, and sensitivity of the operated area over a 3-month period. Furthermore, the wound biofilm will be described through microbiome analysis, and tissue, saliva, and wound exudate biomarkers will be characterized.

    "detailed_description": "Insulin resistance is a key underlying factor promoting hyperglycemia and hypertension in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who have a 3-fold greater cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk when compared with healthy controls. Despite several therapeutic approaches that favor insulin sensitivity through a variety of purported mechanisms (e.g. weight loss, incretins, AMPK activation, reduction in bioactive lipids: DAG/ceramides, etc.), long-term progression of glucose deterioration occurs. This suggests adjunctive targets may be important to prevent/reverse T2D. Studies show that extracellular vesicles (EVs) obtained from plasma are involved in obesity-induced insulin resistance at levels of adipocytes, muscle, and liver. However, little is known how plasma EVs affect vascular insulin action in humans. This is of clinical relevance as EVs enhance the Framingham Risk Score, suggesting EVs are a unique factor promoting CVD. This proposal will fill this knowledge gap by conducting a translational study in 3 distinct groups of people separated by obesity and T2D. The investigators hypothesize that 1) insulin will promote EV uptake and modify insulin signaling in endothelial cells, 2) EVs from adults with T2D will impair vessel reactivity compared to controls; 3) insulin will alter circulating EV insulin signaling and cargo, and 4) exercise training will change EV uptake and cargo as well as EV mediated vascular reactivity to insulin as well as relate to improved vascular function in humans.",

Identifying innovative lifestyle strategies to reduce metabolic risk remains a public health priority. Further research is essential to understand how low carbohydrate intake influences human metabolism and how intermittent carbohydrate restriction impacts weight loss and metabolic health markers.\n\nThis study will investigate two interventions that restrict dietary carbohydrate intake on different schedules, examining their effects on metabolic health and energy balance in adults with abdominal overweight or obesity. The physiological mechanisms potentially underlying these effects will be explored by measuring a range of lifestyle and metabolic health parameters in both free-living and laboratory settings. A digital behaviour-change intervention will be incorporated after the dietary intervention to assess whether any metabolic effects can be sustained over time.\n\nThe study employs a three-arm parallel-group design consisting of a two-week lifestyle monitoring phase, a four-week dietary intervention, and a four-week digital intervention, with four laboratory visits throughout each phase. During the dietary intervention, participants will be allocated to one of three groups: (i) carbohydrate restriction (\\<8% of energy intake) on two consecutive days per week, (ii) carbohydrate restriction after 4 pm each day, or (iii) no dietary changes.\n\nDietary intake, physical activity, and glucose levels will be monitored through wearable devices in free-living conditions. The digital intervention will use a mobile health application that provides individualised lifestyle recommendations and education based on data collected in free-living conditions. Laboratory-based measures will include anthropometry, body composition scans, indirect calorimetry, blood pressure monitoring, fat biopsies, and postprandial sampling of blood and expired air.",

    "brief_summary": "The prospective observational study entitled \"Heidelberg Study on Diabetes and Complications\" is designed to Monitor the presence and development of diabetic complications in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, as well as pre-diabetics. Mail Goal is to detect new metabolic mechanisms or new risk factors for the development of diabetic complications in order to identify risk-subgroups. Non-diabetic controls will be enrolled for reference and comparison.",
    "detailed_description": "The prospective observational study entitled \"Heidelberg Study on Diabetes and Complications\" is designed to show that diabetes according to the current medical definition does not exist. Without question, there is an autoimmune disease that destroys beta cells in the pancreas, which leads to absolute insulin deficiency with consecutively elevated blood glucose levels. This disease is defined as diabetes mellitus type 1. Insulin treatment is absolutely necessary in this state, since absolute insulin deficiency leads to lipolysis with consecutive ketoacidosis and eventually death. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is generally defined as relative insulin deficiency with consecutively elevated blood glucose levels. This disease is often mentioned in the context of the metabolic syndrome, which additionally comprises obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, only the name \"diabetes mellitus\" is shared by these two diseases, which means \"sweet flow\", therefore only describing a symptom.\n\nMultiple interventional studies were aimed on avoiding or reducing the development of late diabetic complications (nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy). This is true for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Up to this day, no study was able to demonstrate that treatment of normalization of blood glucose levels reduces or even reverses development of these complications. Moreover, several type 2 diabetic patients developed typical diabetic complications before definitive manifestation of the actual disease.\n\nTherefore, we hypothesize that late diabetic complications stand in no primary context with blood glucose control, but are associated with other metabolic disorders. One aspect are reactive metabolites (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-DG), which are formed in glycolysis and lipolysis in the context of energy production of cells. These metabolites are detoxified to lactate by certain enzymes. In case this detoxification is compromised, or production of these metabolites elevated, so called advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) can form. Moreover, within the process of energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxydative stress are more pronounced, which can have direct influence on cellular metabolism. This interaction leads to inflammation and DNA damage. Survival of the cells is dependent on defense mechanisms, which seem to be genetically determined, with cellular ageing playing a role as well (cellular senescence). With advanced ageing, cells lose these defense mechanisms against these permanent metabolic attacks.\n\nTherefore, the following hypotheses arise:\n\n1. Diabetes mellitus type 2 is no independent disease, but a late complication of metabolic imbalance\n2. Typical \"late diabetic complications\" are not based on insufficient blood glucose lowering therapy, but on the basis of this metabolic imbalance, and can therefore affect every patient, even without manifested \"diabetes mellitus type 2\"\n3. Diabetes mellitus type 1 is an autoimmundisease with consecutive absolute insulin deficiency, however manifestation of late diabetic complications is based on the same metabolic dysbalance (overlap with type 2).\n\nIn order to investigate these hypotheses, study participants will be profoundly examined once yearly concerning glycemic metabolic state and clinical findings related to micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications, Moreover, reactive metabolites like AGEs, ROS, methylglyoxal, and DNA damage as well as other parameters associated with cellular senescence will be examined. We will also collect information concerning quality of life, well-being, depression, and neuropathic pain.\n\nThis is the first study of its kind to include non-diabetics, pre-diabetics, and diabetics with the possibility to study differences and common ground regarding cellular metabolism. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no precise clinical characterization of peripheral nerve function in pre-diabetics, although some of these patients already complain about neuropathic symptoms. In addition to that, the natural clinical course not only in diabetics, but also in pre-diabetics will be observed over a longer period of time. Finally, changes in surrogate markers over the natural course of pre-diabetes can be observed for the first time, onset of type 1 or type 2 diabetes can be registered immediately, and all patients can be directly compared to healthy controls.",

    "detailed_description": "Obesity and associated metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes continue to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, demanding additional research into novel treatments beyond our current options. One promising experimental approach to overcome the metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity, such as insulin resistance and glucose imbalance, is to activate brown fat non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). Activated human brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases energy expenditure at a molecular level and is associated with both improved insulin tolerance and glucose homeostasis. A critical limitation with human brown fat as a therapeutic option, however, is that its beneficial metabolic potential is restricted in a silenced state under physiological temperature conditions for most of human life. The regulatory factors that govern this silencing process are completely unknown. While many groups continue to seek novel mechanisms to activate brown fat, this study presents a unique approach, aiming to decipher the mechanisms that govern human brown fat silencing. The study hypothesizes that if the regulatory factors that silence brown fat NST can be defined, then these factors can be targeted for ablation to eliminate the \"off switch\", thereby keeping brown fat in a constitutively active state. Identification of human NST silencing factors will be critical to unlocking the metabolic benefits of human brown fat and would represent promising treatment opportunities for type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related disorders. Understanding these relationships will allow for precision treatment opportunities for type 2 diabetes in the future.\n\nThe overall goal of this study is to unlock the metabolic benefits of human brown fat by defining the regulatory mechanisms that keep BAT in a silenced state. The study will generate the first human secretome (list of secreted proteins in blood) and transcriptome (list of gene transcripts in adipose tissue) compendium from human plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue respectively which will be composed of target proteins, metabolites, and genes that are differentially expressed in response to NST silencing conditions. Top candidates from the profiling will then be functionally validated in human adipocytes for their role in NST silencing. The study will be an important resource for the field and will identify novel candidates that may harbor regulatory potential to govern the NST silencing process in humans. These factors can then be targeted to promote the constitutive activation of NST in order to overcome the metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and metabolic disease. Given the invasive nature of direct human brown fat sampling, the study will instead interrogate circulating factors in human plasma as a proxy for metabolic health. In addition, the study will also obtain subcutaneous adipose tissue for RNA profiling to identify genes that are upregulated under NST-silenced conditions compared to cold exposure.",

    "brief_summary": "The benefit of weight loss in patients with obesity and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is controversial. Semaglutide has shown cardiovascular (CV) risk-reduction and impact on CV risk factors including overweight, dysglycaemia and hypertension in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The STEP-HFpEF (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People With Obesity and HFpEF) recently demonstrated, at 1-year, to not only reduce weight considerably, but also significantly improve health-related quality of life, functional status scores and 6-min walk distance in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Also, the recently concluded SELECT trial was the first CV outcome trial with semaglutide in patients with overweight or obesity and established CV disease, including heart failure (but no T2D). Semaglutide demonstrated a 20% reduction in MACE, defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.\n\nThese landmark findings have important implications for clinicians -as they mean that weight loss and/or semaglutide as anti-obesity pharmacotherapy could be a treatment strategy for secondary prevention of CV disease in patients with overweight or obesity.\n\nIt is, however, unknown whether weight loss with either calorie-restricted diet or semaglutide has beneficial effects in obese subjects with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Also it is unclear whether semaglutide has cardiovascular benefits irrespective of starting weight and amount of weight loss.\n\nPurpose: The study aims to investigate whether weight loss treatment with semaglutide is superior to weight loss with calorie-restricted diet in improving peak oxygen uptake in patients with obesity and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.",
    "detailed_description": "Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached pandemic proportions. Obesity is known to increase the risk for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, as well as the risk for overt cardiovascular (CV) disease, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. The rising prevalence of obesity may counteract the recent advances in primary and secondary prevention of CV disease. Overweight and obesity are common in patients with CV disease; however, cardiologists face several challenges in managing body weight in this population. Many may not consider obesity as a therapeutic target probably because there were no previous highly effective and safe pharmacologic interventions to consider. In addition, they may not have the expertise or resources to implement lifestyle interventions and may have limited familiarity with obesity pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the long-term CV effects of obesity pharmacotherapy remain uncertain due to limited CV outcome data with weight loss as the primary intervention. Although current CV guidelines recognize the importance of weight loss, they primarily focus on lifestyle modifications, with fewer details on strategies to utilize obesity pharmacotherapy and surgery. However, the recent 2022 American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus on the management of Type 2 diabetes has moved up weight management to the front of the treatment algorithm, by prioritizing the use of pharmacologic interventions such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which have potent weight-lowering effects, in addition to glucose-lowering effects.\n\nHypothesis: The investigators hypothesise that weight loss treatment with semaglutide is superior to weight loss with state-of-the-art calorie-restricted diet in improving the peak oxygen uptake (ml/min/kg) after 52 weeks as a marker of physical performance (and with prognostic implications) in patients with obesity and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n\nDesign: This is a investigator-initiated, parallel-group, 2-arm assessor-blinded, open-label, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effect of weight loss using low-calorie replacement diet to weight loss using semaglutide in obese patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either low-calorie replacement diet or semaglutide.The subjects wil be followed for 52 weeks during the intervention period. The patients will be examined at 16 weeks (where the weight loss is anticipated to be approximately equal in the two groups) and after 52 weeks.\n\nPrimary, secondary and exploratory objectives are listed below. The exploratory objectives are mostly embedded mechanistic studies of an exploratory nature and therefore hypothesis-generating in the RCT.\n\nIntervention: Subjects will be treated with semaglutide once weekly or a weight loss intervention consisting of a calorie-restricted diet and dietary advice on top of standard of care, which covers management of heart failure medication, CV risk factors and healthy lifestyle counselling.",

    "detailed_description": "The overall objective of this study is to determine if behaviorally informed marketing strategies or those same strategies plus dynamically adapted financial incentives can prompt consumers with prediabetes or diabetes to switch from refined to whole grain products when grocery shopping online. The specific aims of the study are:\n\nAim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) via an online grocery delivery platform and to refine mechanism-based marketing nudges and incentives based on user insights. The overall objective of this aim is to customize the online grocery store experience to align with the needs of the consumers while also supporting the objectives of the two intervention arms outlined in Aim 2. Customizations will include displaying whole grains (e.g., whole wheat bread, brown rice) at the top of the study's online grocery store, featuring whole grain banner displays, and offering product swaps to highlight whole grain alternatives. Additionally, the study team will ensure that all refined grain items have corresponding whole grain options, to the extent possible. To evaluate the platform's usability and gather insights for refining the interventions, the study team will recruit 9 participants to test the customized online grocery store. Participants will provide feedback on the online shopping environment and whole grain options in an end-of-study survey. This feedback will be used to refine the marketing nudge interventions for Aim 2.\n\nAim 2: To test whether behaviorally informed marketing strategies or those same strategies plus dynamically adapted financial incentives can prompt consumers with prediabetes or diabetes to switch from buying refined grain products to whole grain products when grocery shopping online. Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of three intervention arms: 1) control (no intervention), 2) marketing nudges, or 3) marketing nudges + dynamically adapted financial incentives. Participants will select groceries from the study's online grocery store, and the orders will be delivered to their homes via a third-party delivery service. The first two weeks will serve as a baseline period for data collection. Starting in Week 3, participants in intervention arms 2 and 3 will be exposed to marketing nudges promoting whole grains for 8 weeks. Participants in the third intervention arm will additionally receive personalized financial incentives with individual incentive amounts optimized weekly based on prior whole grain purchasing behavior and engagement. In a typical healthy eating incentive study, all participants would get the same incentive amount each week. An innovative aspect of this study is to dynamically adapt the incentive, so each person experiences a personalized offering of incentives each week based on their whole grain shopping habits in prior weeks. This means participants who did not buy a whole grain item in response to a smaller incentive in a prior week may receive a larger incentive than participants who did purchase whole grains when offered the smaller incentive. This will not be gameable since it will not be apparent to participants a priori. This approach enables us to mimic current retailer practices, rather than more outdated strategies that provide the same incentive weekly.\n\nAim 3: To examine whether whole grain purchasing behaviors have become habitual and persist after the marketing nudges and dynamically adapted financial incentives cease. The overall objective of this aim is to explore the potential for marketing strategies and dynamically adapted financial incentives to create lasting changes in grocery shopping habits, specifically by examining whether participants continue purchasing whole grain products once the intervention has ended. Participants will be followed for an additional 8 weeks post-intervention to track their online grocery shopping behavior in the absence of the marketing nudges and financial incentives. During this period, participants will continue to shop through the study's online grocery store and have their groceries delivered to them through a third-party delivery service. In addition, for the first 4 weeks of follow-up, they will continue to receive their weekly $10 incentive if they shop in the study's online grocery store. At the conclusion of the study, participants will receive a $25 incentive for completing a survey assessing the intervention's salience, their acceptance of whole grains, and any remaining barriers to switching to whole grains.",

    "detailed_description": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the DIPAR digital tool in improving the management process of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\nThe DIPAR tool consists of two core functionalities designed to support diabetes management: a reminder function and a consultation dashboard.\n\n1. Reminder Function The reminder feature aims to encourage timely diabetes-related clinical follow-ups. It provides patients with automated notifications through the MyNexuzhealth patient portal, usually installed in the mobile phones of the patients, when their measurements for HbA1c and Albuminuria are overdue. These reminders align with the minimal follow-up requirements in Belgium, where HbA1c must be measured biannually and albuminuria annually. We hypothesize that these reminders will prompt patients to schedule routine clinical follow-ups with their general practitioner or diabetes specialist.\n\n   Notification schedule\n   * HbA1c: First reminder after 7 months without a measurement; second reminder 4 weeks later if still overdue.\n   * Albuminuria: First reminder after 13 months without a measurement; second reminder 4 weeks later if still overdue.\n2. Consultation Dashboard\n\n   The consultation dashboard will be provided study participants at the participating institution and will display the following relevant clinical data, extracted from the medical dossier of the diabetes specialist in a visual and colourful display of the progress over time:\n   * Clinical outcomes: HbA1c (%), LDL-C (mg/dl), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), albuminuria (mg/gACR), eGFR (ml/min/1.73m2) and BMI (weight/lenght2)\n\n   Additionally, the tool includes a questionnaire that patients can complete before consultations to provide insights into their behavior and attitudes toward self-management during the consultations with their physicians. This will include lifestyle-related questions including: medication intake, smoking, weight, fruit and vegetable intake in weekly diet, intake of sugary snacks and drinks, weekly physical activity, and whether or not diabetic foot and fundoscopy examination have occurred.\n\n   The trial will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, participants in the intervention group will have access to the reminder function of the DIPAR extension. In Phase 2, they will additionally use the consultation dashboard alongside their diabetes specialist, while retaining access to the reminder function. This phased approach ensures a gradual introduction of the tool, reduces complexity for participants, and allows assessment of the reminder function's impact on diabetes management processes before incorporating the dashboard.\n\n   Research Question Does the use of the DIPAR tool improve the measurement and documentation of clinical parameters and increase adherence to recommended diabetes care, particularly the measurement of albuminuria in individuals with T2DM?\n\n   Primary Objective The primary objective is to assess whether the implementation of the DIPAR tool can increase the proportion of patients who receive at least one annual measurement of albuminuria, performed either by the general practitioner (GP) or a diabetes specialist, as documented in the electronic medical record (EMD), thereby reflecting improved monitoring of diabetes-related parameters.\n\n   Secondary Objectives The key secondary objective is to assess whether the proportion of patients with at least two documented HbA1c measurements in the EMD reports of the GP or diabetes specialist increases with the use of the DIPAR tool.\n\n   The exploratory secondary objectives are:\n\n   \u2022 To determine the proportion of patients with T2DM who have their HbA1c measurements documented in the EMD of i. the general practitioner and ii. the diabetes specialist.\n   * To explore the perceived usability and acceptability of the digital tool among both patients and healthcare providers, as well as its potential to improve health literacy in patients within the intervention group.\n   * To evaluate changes in key diabetes-related clinical parameters, specifically HbA1c, albuminuria, LDL-cholesterol, and blood pressure over the study duration.\n\n   Study Duration\n\n   The study is expected to last approximately 15 months (October 2025-January 2027).

    "brief_summary": "Glycemic control is a mainstay of diabetes management to reduce the risk of microvascular complications and cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, intensive control to near-normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) yielded complex results in previous landmark trials. Potential risks of intensive glycemic control, such as hypoglycemia and weight gain, may partly contributed to the possible harms associated with this approach. Recent advances in diabetes management with development of newer antidiabetic drugs which minimize possible harms of intensive glycemic control as well as reduce cardiorenal risks enabled safer glycemic reduction. Thus, this randomized trial aims to evaluate the effects of near normalization of HbA1c with novel approaches on microvascular complications and cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2D.",

    "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nOver the past few decades Non-Alcoholic Fatty liver disease (NAFLD) related non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis has overtaken all other causes of liver cirrhosis in the developed world, secondary to the rising epidemic of obesity and type 2 Diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of NAFL is estimated at 30% in developed work and nearly one fifth of them NFALD will progress to NASH, 20% of which will develop liver cirrhosis subsequently leading to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Annual medical costs directly attributed to NAFLD exceed \u20ac35 billion in top European countries (United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy) and over $100 billion in the United States, while cost of this in unknown in Middle East. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as fatty infiltration of the liver not related to alcohol excess or other usual causes of hepatic steatosis (e.g. viral or autoimmune hepatitis or secondary to medications) and includes a spectrum ranging from steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis to cirrhosis; it is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Although most patients with NAFLD may not progress to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, due to the high prevalence the number of patients develop cirrhosis is still high and is now a leading indication for liver transplantation in Europe. Global prevalence data for NAFLD suggest that the, Midlle East region has one of the highest prevalence rate of up to 32%.Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with recent metanalysis showing that the global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM to be around 55.5% with no specific available data for Emirati population with respects to NAFLD in T2DM patients. Obesity is another well-known risk factor and there is high prevalence of NAFLD in obese patients, with up to 65% of people with grade I-II obesity (BMI = 30-39.9 kg/m2) and in 85% of patients with grade III obesity (BMI = 40-59 kg/m2) having NAFLD.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest prevalence of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the world with 16.4% of adult population diagnosed with this condition as per International Diabetes federation. UAE also has the highest prevalence of obesity, doubled from 1989 to 2017, currently ranking among the top 40 countries in the world with estimated prevalence rate of 31.7%, using body mass index (BMI) cut-off of 30 kg/m2. This rate will be substantially higher if newer definition of ethnicity specific BMI cut off for obesity (i.e. \\> 25 kg/m2 being obese) is used, which is more relevant for Asian population. The presence of both these conditions means UAE is likely to have very high prevalence of NAFLD in patients having both diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe gold standard test for identifying NALFD and Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver biopsy. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure and is associated with complications. A non-invasive method using Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) utilizing FibroScan provides a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) expressed in kilopascals (kPa) which correlate with fibrosis advanced stages like F3 (bridging fibrosis) with LSM of 9.9-13.9 KPa and F4 (advanced scarring or cirrhosis) quite well and has emerged as an alternative to invasive liver biopsy. Other non-invasive tools used to detect the presence of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD include clinical/biochemical scoring systems like NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI), Enhanced Liver Fibrosis panel, Hepascore; and imaging techniques like VCTE or magnetic resonance elastography(MRE). The NFS is based on six clinical/biochemical variables including age, presence of impaired fasting glucose or Diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), platelet count, albumin and AST/ALT (alanine aminotransferase) ratio. A recent large meta-analysis, showed that NFS had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.85 for predicting advanced fibrosis stages like F3 (bridging fibrosis) and F4 (advanced scarring or cirrhosis) with a score of 0.676 or more having 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity to identify the presence of advanced fibrosis. A recent study that compared various risk scores and elastography (including MRE and VCTE) versus liver histology to identify NAFLD fibrosis showed that NFS were better than other indices such as BARD, APRI, and AST/ALT ratio; and found to be as good as MRE and and FIB-4 for predicting advanced fibrosis in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Recent guidelines therefore recommend NFS as a clinically useful tool for identifying patients with NAFLD with a higher likelihood of having advanced fibrosis (F3 or F4).\n\nCurrently various treatments have been used for NALFD. The current guidelines from American Association for study of liver diseases suggests that Pioglitazone can improve histological appearance in patient with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and NASH while Vitamin E may offer benefit in non-diabetic population, while GLP-1 Analgoues like liraglutide could be beneficial however there is not enough evidence for it to be used routinely for patients with NASH.\n\nThere is no current data on use of Tirzepatide with NAFLD in Emirati population. There is no literature, to the best of authors knowledge. This study offers our centre and UAE university to be first in the world to trial this study without any known risks and publish new and unique data.\n\nThe aim of this study to assess the effects of GLP-1 analogues (subcutaneous Tirzepatide or oral semaglutide) in reducing the fat content and Liver stiffness (using non-invasive imaging methods) in patients with established advanced liver fibrosis with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in local population.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nPrimary Aim:\n\nTo see if GLP-1 analogue causes reduction in liver fat on imaging in patient with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and NAFLD in our population\n\nSecondary Aims To assess any changes in liver function tests/biochemical profile To see improvement in in NAFLD fibrosis score and it relation to liver fat measurement To see improvement in physical parameters such as weight, BMI, blood pressure To see improvement in blood glucose, HbA1c To assess any reported side effects or tolerability of this combination in local population\n\nMethods, Specific Tasks and Time Schedule:\n\nSTUDY DESIGN It is Prospective open label randomized study of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending Tawam Hospital Diabetes clinic meeting the selection criteria as below\n\nDATA COLLECTION:\n\nThe adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending Tawam Hospital Diabetes clinic, who are identified as having fatty liver disease either via ultrasound or biochemical parameter of NFS. . The NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) will be calculated using the published formula (available at website http://gihep.com/calculators/hepatology/nafld-fibrosis-score/).\n\nThe investigators will aim to include minimum 30 patients fulfilling the selection criteria as below. Informed written consent will be obtained and the group will receive GLP-1 analogues (subcutaneous Tirzepatide or oral semaglutide). The dose of oral semaglutide will be 3 mg daily for 30 days (initiation) and if dose then increased to 7 mg daily for 6 months while the dose of Tirzepatide is 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks then 0.5 mg once weekly. The blood tests will be done at baseline, 3 months of treatment and at 6 months of treatment. Liver imaging (fibroscan and/or MRI fat measurement) will be done at baseline and at 6 months to see if there is any change.",

    "detailed_description": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant. Over 1 in 3 infants born to individuals with T2D will experience an adverse outcome, including large for gestational age at birth, preterm birth, birth trauma, neonatal hypoglycemia, and stillbirth. Strict maternal glycemic control throughout pregnancy is key to optimizing perinatal outcomes. This is possible with insulin pharmacotherapy, vigilant glucose monitoring, lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise, and team-based prenatal care. Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D experience non-medical social needs that limit their ability to achieve glycemic control, including lack of reliable transportation to attend prenatal visits, access to resources to engage in diet and exercise changes, and convenient methods to log self-monitored glucose values and adjust insulin dosing.\n\nA multi-faceted provider-patient based approach is needed with proven strategies to improve glycemic control. We propose \"ACHIEVE: Successfully achieving and maintaining euglycemia during pregnancy for type 2 diabetes through technology and coaching.\" Our intervention is multi-component, including a mobile health (mHealth) application (app), provider dashboard, DEXCOM continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and care team coaching for medical and social needs. This intervention empowers Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D and their healthcare providers to achieve and maintain glycemic control, improve access to care, and provide patient education and support. Each sub-component of the proposed intervention is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and emphasizes on individuals' skills, knowledge and beliefs, and self-efficacy to achieve glycemic control.\n\nWe propose four aims: AIM 1: Develop the tailored ACHIEVE mHealth app and provider dashboard for Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D and their healthcare team through active stakeholder engagement; AIM 2: Conduct an RCT and measure the effect of the intervention (mHealth app with CGM, provider dashboard, and care team coaching) compared to current standard care (prenatal visits, self-monitored blood glucose, and certified diabetes care and education specialist) on achieving glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c \\<6.5% in the third trimester). We hypothesize a 25% absolute increase in the proportion of participants in the intervention group who will meet the target hemoglobin A1c \\<6.5% in the third trimester compared to the standard care group; and AIM 3: Identify multi-level patient and provider barriers and facilitators to satisfaction, engagement, and use of the intervention and its subcomponents. AIM 4: Examine postpartum (i.e. 6-12 months after delivery) diabetes and reproductive health outcomes in both intervention and standard care arms.",

    "brief_summary": "The goal of this study is to learn about how the hormone insulin controls blood sugar. The main question it aims to answer is about how much insulin the body actually needs to maintain a normal blood sugar level. People with obesity and high insulin levels will receive eight doses of diazoxide, a drug that suppresses the pancreas's production of insulin, and will have their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels checked daily while taking the drug.",
    "detailed_description": "The investigators are interested in determining to what extent the hyperinsulinemia commonly associated with insulin resistance (IR) in those at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a primary phenomenon, rather than merely a secondary, compensatory response to IR. The study hypothesis is that some people with obesity and hyperinsulinemia exhibit a primary, non-compensatory hyperinsulinemia that may foment IR and its dysmetabolic sequelae. If this were the case, lowering insulin levels should not result in a proportional rise in blood glucose as might be expected if the hyperinsulinemia truly were purely compensatory. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove, however, because of the tight feedback mechanism between blood glucose and insulin secretion; under normal circumstances insulin secretion declines only alongside blood glucose. As such, an attempt to lower insulin levels independently of blood glucose will raise blood glucose and trigger further insulin secretion, negating the purpose of the experiment. In order to circumvent this feedback regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the study team has developed a modification of the insulin suppression test (IST) called the \"graded IST\" (GIST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with octreotide and then measures steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) at both replacement euinsulinemia and hyperinsulinemia. It is expected that some people with high insulin levels at baseline will not demonstrate a prominent rise in SSPG even when their insulin levels are lowered. However, the GIST is a cumbersome procedure that is difficult to scale for larger study populations. As such, the investigators are also working to develop an outpatient diazoxide suppression test (DzST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with the oral insulin anti-secretagogue diazoxide rather than octreotide, and will validate it against the incipient \"gold-standard\" GIST. GIST participants found to have evidence of primary hyperinsulinemia (i.e., euinsulinemic euglycemia or near-euglycemia despite baseline hyperinsulinemia) will, several weeks later, take diazoxide 3 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, for four days. The investigators will check fasting glucose and insulin levels daily at baseline and then after each of the four days of diazoxide administration. The investigators expect that suppression of insulin secretion with diazoxide will, in accordance with the GIST, lead to no significant rise in blood glucose in people who have true primary hyperinsulinemia.",

The authors stated that \"findings suggest new sensory balance cues provided to the lower limb can modulate the activity of relevant nerve afferents and become integrated into sensorimotor control of balance and gait.\"\n\nIn 2020 a multi-site clinical trial of the long-term effects of daily Walkasins use (walk2Wellness, ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT03538756) was published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience. After 10 weeks of Walkasins use, this long-term study demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) and gait speed, which is associated with a lower fall risk. The authors concluded that \"a wearable sensory prosthesis may provide a new way to treat gait and balance problems and manage falls in high fall-risk patients with PN.\"\n\nMost recently, an analysis of data from 26 weeks of Walkasins use in the walk2Wellness trial showed that \"participants who reported falls over 6 months prior to the study had a 43% decrease in fall rate during the study as compared to self-report 6-month pre-study (11.8 vs. 6.7 falls/1000 patient days, respectively, p \\<0.004), similar to the 46% decrease reported after 10 weeks of use.\"\n\nThe present study involves an assessment of Walkasins through a randomized, controlled trial with a primary endpoint of 26 weeks. Furthermore, this study will enroll only individuals 55 and older with a goal of including participants that reflect the Medicare population to support payer reimbursement for Walkasins.\n\nThe objectives of this study are as follows:\n\n* Reflect real-world use of Walkasins in a Medicare-representative population who have sensory peripheral neuropathy and associated gait and balance problems and who would be eligible for a prescription to use the device.\n* Investigate the impact of Walkasins use on relevant clinical outcomes associated with gait and physical function.\n* Demonstrate based on patient reporting that Walkasins improves awareness of foot placement on the ground indicating partial replacement of plantar mechanoreceptor function, lost due to peripheral neuropathy.\n* Investigate whether plantar monofilament testing at levels \\<10g (5.07, LOPS) are associated with gait and balance issues. Is there a Loss Of Balance Sensation (LOBS) threshold that is \\<10g? The monofilament test protocol should include plantar sites across the foot since differences in anteroposterior and/or mediolateral sensitivity may cause balance issues.\n* Compare the rate of injurious falls between a group of Walkasins users and non-users over a six-month period.",

    "detailed_description": "Optimizing the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) will remain a major public health concern for decades to come. T2DM has already affected 4% of the French population and generates each year over 12 billion euros of expenditure. By combining therapies, oral and/or injectable (insulin or analogues of GLP-1), the current management of T2DM provides two thirds of patients with a satisfactory metabolic control (HbA1c \\< 7%) and reduced incidence of cardiovascular complications. Its effect on mortality, however, remains more limited, presumably because of the persistence of other cardiovascular risk factors. A recent study has confirmed that French patients with T2DM present an overall mortality risk significantly higher than the general population. In France, this group registered a mortality of 32 deaths per 1000 persons.\n\nBariatric surgery is now a recognized method for the treatment of severe obesity. It allows for the permanent loss of at least 50% of initial excess weight. In obese patients, this surgery is also associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors and particularly T2D. A recent meta-analysis of retrospective studies available suggests that surgery results in remission of T2DM in over 75% of cases. The only prospective randomized study showed that gastric restriction by placing a gastric band, provides better glycemic control than just medical treatment in obese patients with recently discovered T2DM. The gastric by-pass (GBP) which also includes an intestinal by-pass, seems to have an even higher metabolic efficiency than gastric bypass alone. In patients with T2DM, the GBP restores postprandial insulin secretion independently of weight loss. Despite the significant morbidity of the intervention, long-term results seem broadly supportive of the GBP. In a large case-control study, GBP was associated with a decrease of 90% of deaths related to diabetes. In a controlled study conducted in surgical candidates obese diabetics, the GBP decreased the overall world mortality by 75% after 6 years. Despite these very encouraging data, the GBP is now proposed to only a small proportion (\\< 1%) of patients likely to benefit from the procedure.",

The aim of this study to develop an intervention to prevent diabetes in the Hispanic community and inform policies about social determinants of health.",
    "detailed_description": "Social determinants of health are associated with developing diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes) onset, progression, and adverse outcomes. Hispanics have a 50% lifetime risk of developing diabetes. They also transition from pre-diabetes to diabetes faster and have an earlier onset of diabetes and its complications than the general population. People with a family history of diabetes are 7.6 times more likely to develop diabetes than individuals without such a history. Diabetes research uses hemoglobin A1C (A1C), the accumulation of glucose on hemoglobin molecules during the past three months, as the measure of diabetes control. However, A1C is an insensitive measure of glucose for those at risk for developing diabetes because glucose spikes and variability are often masked in an average glucose level by A1C. Glucose spikes should rarely occur and can be an early indicator of insulin insufficiency. Constant glucose monitors (CGM) can detect glucose spikes and have successfully lowered A1C in people with diabetes.\n\nUsing CGM, Hispanic adults with familial risk factors of diabetes can obtain a more detailed assessment of their glucose levels and identify foods, activities, emotions, and stress that impact their glucose levels. Time constraints can often be a barrier to participating in an intervention. The proposed intervention will test an asynchronous nurse-led intervention. To address this gap and create an intervention, glucose variability in Hispanics at risk for diabetes will be investigate to identify glucose variability predictors and create a culturally tailored intervention to prevent diabetes.\n\nDiagnosis of glucose intolerance, or prediabetes, can be evaluated using an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) to illustrate a person's ability to produce and use insulin in response to glucose consumption. The medical community uses these lab values as benchmarks. Knowing the starting level of participants' glucose tolerance will allow us to better interpret the CGM findings. Additionally, it will provide validity for using CGMs in the population at risk for diabetes.\n\nTherefore, the specific aims are as follows:\n\n1. To examine the relationship between social determinants and glucose control. These analyses estimate the associations between economic instability, neighborhood vulnerability, food insecurity, and healthcare quality with glucose variability.\n2. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a CGM intervention for Hispanics at risk of diabetes. The study compares synchronous or asynchronous diabetes education intervention. The participants will receive education and feedback based on their CGM results, either in person or via videos.",

    "detailed_description": "Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D), an increasingly common and aggressive disease that disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities, presents several diagnostic challenges. The rapid loss of glycemic control soon after T2D diagnosis makes early identification an important goal in pediatrics, and risk-based screening has been recommended for children for over two decades. However, the screening tests currently used in practice, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), have significant drawbacks. Real-time continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are promising new tools for risk stratification in individuals with dysglycemia. These patient-worn medical devices measure interstitial glucose every 5 minutes and offer glimpses into an individual's everyday life, which may include consumption of carbohydrates in amounts larger than that assessed in an OGTT, enhancing test sensitivity. Whether use of CGMs to evaluate type 2 diabetes risk in free-living youth is feasible and acceptable to patients and families is unknown. Assessment of CGM with standardized, but practical, home-based glucose and mixed-meal challenges is needed to determine facilitators and barriers to use of this technology-driven approach in clinical practice. Without advancement in the approach to screening for youth-onset T2D, there is ongoing risk of failure to understand which individuals are at highest risk for complications and could benefit the most from intervention early in the disease process.\n\nIn this single-arm prospective study, participants will attend one in-person study visit to complete 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test after overnight fast. Participants will wear a continuous glucose monitor and a wrist-worn actigraphy device for physical activity and sleep measurement for 10 days beginning on the day of the study visit, then return the monitors by mail. During the 10 day wear period, participants will respond to text message-based surveys to document food intake, physical activity, and sleep times and will complete two at-home challenges: 1) glucose challenge using study-provided glucose beverage that is identical to that they consume during clinical oral glucose tolerance test; and 2) food challenge with mixed carbohydrate/fat/protein-containing food of their choice. Glucose trends during these at-home challenges will be compared with oral glucose tolerance test obtained during the study visit. Individual interviews will be conducted upon completion of CGM wear to assess acceptability of the use of at-home glucose challenge and CGM wear as a strategy to evaluate diabetes risk in youth.",

    "brief_summary": "In the general population, the excessive and constant desire to control one's diet and body has become increasingly problematic. Indeed, the demand for control over one's diet and body is now an unspoken social prescription that can lead in some cases to eating disorders. In patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), these concerns are even more central, as they are accentuated by the very nature of the treatment of the disease (dietary modification, insulin compensation according to food intake, etc.). Studies on adolescents with T1D show that the prevalence of eating disorders would be present in at least 1 in 5 patients. Among these disorders, orthorexia is of particular interest. Indeed, orthorexia was defined in 1997 by Steven Bratman as a rigid eating behavior based on the avoidance of foods considered qualitatively unhealthy. More precisely, orthorexia is characterized by a constant preoccupation with one's diet and persistent nutritional (or health) beliefs that take precedence over food pleasure. It has been estimated that the prevalence of orthorexia in patients living with T1D may be as high as 80%. We are currently conducting a study on the mechanisms of orthorexia in the general population of Quebec (the results of phase 1 of this study are being analyzed). We now wish to conduct the same study in a population with T1D, which has a higher prevalence of people with orthorexia nervosa.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of orthorexia nervosa (obsessions and fixations on healthy eating) in the Quebec population with T1D from the BETTER Registry.",
    "detailed_description": "The BETTER registry is supervised by Dr. Rabasa-Lhoret and Dr. Brazeau and co-funded by CIHR and JDRF: more than 2000 patients with T1D are currently in the registry, of which 98% of the participants have agreed to be contacted for future research studies. This will be done by comparing food categorization strategies between control subjects from the previous study (results under analysis) and subjects with orthorexia nervosa traits in the T1D patient population, and also by testing the hypothesis of dysfunctions specific to the orthorexia population of executive functions (including attention, cognitive flexibility, inhibition and working memory) in the general domain and then more specifically in the food domain.\n\nConsidering the existing literature on orthorexia described above, and in particular the definition of orthorexia nervosa (orthorexia nervosa is defined as obsessions and fixations on healthy eating leading to negative emotional and behavioral consequences for the individual, e.g., excessive anxiety, social isolation), as well as the strong correlations observed in the literature between distress, anxiety, and diabetes, the hypotheses are the following:\n\n* Hypothesis 1: The more orthorexic traits subjects exhibit, the more quickly they categorize foods into healthy/unhealthy.\n* Hypothesis 2: The likelihood that a food, regardless of its properties, will be categorized as unhealthy is greater the more orthorexic traits the subjects exhibit.\n* Hypothesis 3: The more orthorexic traits subjects exhibit, the more stable they respond (i.e., they respond in the same way to each repetition of the same stimulus) when it comes to categorizing a food as good or bad for health.\n* Hypothesis 4: The more severe the orthorexia behaviors, the more distressing the patients will express about their T1D.",

    "detailed_description": "Neuropathy affects approximately 30-50% of all diabetic patients and is the commonest form of neuropathy in the developed world. Pain is the most distressing symptom of neuropathy and the main factor that prompts the patient to seek medical advice. About 16-26% of diabetes patients experience chronic neuropathic pain. An animal study revealed that treating rats with \u03b1-tocopherol and tocotrienol for 10 weeks significantly improved all the biochemical and behavioral outcomes of alcohol-induced neuropathy in a dose-dependent manner with more potent effects observed with tocotrienols. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of tocotrienols in attenuation of alcoholic neuropathy.\n\nCognitive dysfunction is a less addressed and not as well recognized complication of diabetes. Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been found to have cognitive deficits that can be attributed to their disease. Both old age and diabetes are independently associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction; the risk is even greater for older adults with diabetes. Cognitive Function is the term used to describe a person's state of consciousness (alertness and orientation), memory, and attention span. It has been suggested that Vitamin E, including tocopherols and tocotrienols, can help to improve cognitive function and stall cognitive decline through its antioxidant effects. A reason for this nutrient's success at preventing oxidative damage in brain cells is its fat-soluble criteria. During the World Alzheimer's Congress held in July 2001, it was reported that high intakes of vitamin E effectively lessened memory loss and cognitive dysfunction among more than 6,000 elderly subjects who were generally taking Vitamin E between 200 to 400 IU per day.\n\nTocotrienols, in particular \u03b1-tocotrienol have been shown to possess neuroprotective effect independent of anti-oxidant activity. Using cell-based studies, \u03b1-tocotrienol but not \u03b1-tocopherol was shown to prevent glutamate-induced neuronal cell death at nanomolar concentrations. Later studies showed that \u03b1-tocotrienol conferred protection against glutamate and stroke-induced neurodegeneration in rats.\n\nIn view of the above neuroprotective property of tocotrienols, researchers have proceeded to demonstrate that tocotrienols supplementation helped to reverse neuropathic pain in diabetic rats. It has been postulated the beneficial properties of tocotrienols are due to their suppressive effects on the oxidative-nitrosative stress, inflammatory cytokine release and caspase-3 which are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nIn the same year, tocotrienols were shown to prevent cognitive deficits and attenuate alcoholic peripheral neuropathy associated with selective neuronal damage due to chronic alcohol consumption. Moreover, the beneficial effects were found to be more pronounced with tocotrienols compared to tocopherols. It has been postulated that the anti-oxidants property of tocotrienols, the suppression of nitrosative stress and elevated cytokines levels together with acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain regions contributes significantly in preventing the chronic alcohol-induced cognitive deficits in rats.\n\nYuen and his group are currently conducting a clinical study in human subjects on neuroprotective effects of tocotrienols (NCT00753532). In the study, subjects were followed up for 2 years to determine the volume of white matter lesions on repeated MRI after treatment with tocotrienol as compared to placebo. White matter lesions are related to vascular events in the brain and represent subclinical infarcts, resulting in death/ degeneration of neurons and are positively correlated to cognitive impairment. Preliminary results from an interim analysis are encouraging; patients on tocotrienols shown significant reduction in volume of white matter lesion (confidential communication).",

    "detailed_description": "There are over one billion Muslims in the world with the majority participating in Ramadan. The prevalence of diabetes in several countries with large Muslim populations is similar to the rates observed in westernised countries, which increases by 10% annually as a result of urbanization and socioeconomic development. Observance of Ramadan is an integral part of Islamic identity being one of the five main pillars that constitute this widely followed religion. Muslims observing Ramadan are required to fast from sunrise to sunset during this holy month. The timing of Ramadan follows the lunar calendar which occurs 10 days earlier each year; this means that the fasting period coincides with the summer season for many consecutive years before moving in line with the winter months. During the summer season Ramadan can take place with the longest hours of daylight which has a greater impact and risk for people with diabetes who fast during this period.\n\nAlthough the Quran exempts \"sick\" people from the duty of fasting many Muslims with diabetes do not consider themselves to be sick and are keen to fast. A recent epidemiological study involving 13 Islamic countries reported that 43% of patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 79% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) fast during this religious period.\n\nConcern for Muslims with diabetes fasting during Ramadan has been recognised by religious leaders and indeed 2009 saw a landmark event. A statement was issued at the meeting of the Council of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Conference at its 19th session. In brief, people with diabetes were classified into four categories in line with expert recommendations published in 2005. Categories 1 and 2 include those with diabetes at very high risk of serious complications and high risk of complications due to fasting, respectively. These two groups are exempt from observing Ramadan. Categories 3 and 4 include those with diabetes who have a medium risk of complications and those with a low risk of complications due to fasting, respectively. The latter two groups are not automatically exempt from observing Ramadan. The risk of complications in this context refers specifically to the likelihood of hypoglycaemic events, and includes other acute illnesses associated with diabetes, patients on renal dialysis, women with diabetes during pregnancy, patients with macrovascular disease, and those who live alone and are on insulin therapy or oral insulin secretagogues. Additionally, all people with T1DM are classed as category 1. However, the impact of the feasting part of Ramadan, for example on hyperglycaemia or deterioration of glycaemic control, is not considered in this statement. Furthermore, it is not known to what extent these guidelines are followed in practice.\n\nThere is an abundance of evidence describing the impact of Ramadan on people with T2DM from retrospective to population-based studies. However, there is a lack of evidence available to help guide the management of people with diabetes who wish to observe Ramadan. Fasting and feasting during this holy month can cause health risks for people with diabetes. The Epidemiology of Diabetes and Ramadan 1422/2001 Study (\"EPIDAR\") was a large population-based, international epidemiological study of diabetes conducted in 13 countries with Muslim populations. One of the aims of this study was to determine the potential effects of fasting in people with diabetes on their well-being and the management of this condition. They observed a 7.5-fold (from 0.4 to 3 events per 100 per month) increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM as a result of a change in eating patterns during Ramadan. Severe hypoglycaemia was defined as hypoglycaemia leading to hospitalization. Additionally a 5-fold increase in the incidence of severe hyperglycaemia with/without ketoacidosis was observed in patients with T2DM.\n\nOther risks for people with diabetes who fast during Ramadan include diabetic ketoacidosis due to a lack of insulin, dehydration due to lack of fluid intake during the fasting period, and orthostatic hypotension in addition to an increased risk of thrombosis due to increased blood viscosity secondary to dehydration. Only 62% of those with T2DM in the \"EIPDAR\" study reported receiving recommendations from their health care providers. These recommendations should include changes in lifestyle (diet and physical activity) and in medication choice and dosage to limit the potential complications of fasting and feasting for this patient population.\n\nThere have been significant advances in glucose lowering therapies in T2DM and their availability, thus offering a greater choice of therapies to people with diabetes with the potential for supporting safer fasting. Three new classes of therapy have been licensed for the treatment of T2DM in the United Kingdom (UK) in the past 10 years. The most recent class that has been introduced are the Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors). There are six known members of the SGLT family to date. Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122), a once daily tablet, is one of a number of SGLT2 inhibitors that have been licensed within the UK. This medication is taken once daily orally (either 100 or 300mg). Phase III trials of this novel agent have reported reductions in HbA1c between 0.70 and 1.16%, body weight reduction between 1.8 and 3.7% and systolic blood pressure reduction between 1.6 and 6.6mmHg (millimetre of mercury) from baseline. Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) has a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. Importantly this drug is reported to be well-tolerated and has a good safety profile in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM as monotherapy or in combination with other glucose lowering therapy including sulphonylureas and metformin.\n\nIn 2016, Ramadan takes place throughout the months of June and July. At this time of year in the UK, between dawn and sunset there are approximately 14.5 hours of daylight at the beginning and 13 hours towards the end of Ramadan during which there is fasting. This is a significant portion of the 24 hour day; thus abstinence from food for such a prolonged period poses an increased risk for those with T2DM especially if their medicine regimens are not altered to accommodate this. In light of this the study aims to determine if the addition of Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) therapy to monotherapy of metformin is more effective at achieving the double composite endpoint of a reduction in HbA1c (\u2265 0.3%) and weight loss (\u22651kg) 3-4 weeks post-Ramadan. The study will also include patients currently on dual therapy, specifically metformin plus a sulphonylurea, pioglitazone or repaglinide to determine whether switching to metformin plus Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) is more effective at achieving the composite endpoint compared to those remaining on previous dual therapy. There are a number of secondary outcomes including weight loss, rates of hypoglycaemia, blood pressure and a number of biochemical endpoints.\n\nThe study will also include an objective measure of glycaemic status using a Flash Glucose Monitoring System (FGMS) called a \"FreeStyle Libre\" sensor in a sub-set of participants (15-20 participants). Participants can 'opt-in' to the FGMS sub-study and the device will be worn before medication is initiated and at the first follow-up visit 3-4 weeks post Ramadan. The study will also invite those participating in the sub-study to wear the device during Ramadan. The use of FGMS will provide up to 14 days of blood glucose readings taken every 15 minutes allowing us to apply glycaemic thresholds to the uploaded data and calculate the proportion of time spent in hypo, hyper or normoglycaemic states in the two treatment groups.\n\nThere is limited evidence on the changes in levels of physical activity for people who observe Ramadan. It is widely believed that levels of physical activity are reduced due to a fear of feeling too weak \\[29\\]. To address this, the study will objectively measure physical activity levels before, during and after Ramadan in a sub-set of participants (15-20 participants) in addition to using the self-reported validated international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).\n\nIt is hypothesised that therapy based on Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) is more effective than sulphonylurea-based regimen at helping people with established T2DM who are observing Ramadan to achieve the double composite endpoint of a reduction in HbA1c (\u2265 0.3%) and weight loss (\u22651kg) 3-4 weeks post-Ramadan.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\nThis is an open label randomised controlled trial with two cohorts:\n\n1. Cohort 1 - Individuals on metformin monotherapy will be randomised (1:1) to either the addition of Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) or repaglinide, a sulphonylurea or pioglitazone, and\n2. Cohort 2 - Individuals on dual therapy (metformin plus repaglinide, a sulphonylurea or pioglitazone) will be randomised (1:1) to either continuation of their current therapy or to switch to metformin and Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) Randomisation will be stratified by site and entry therapy (monotherapy OR dual therapy which includes metformin plus pioglitazone, or metformin plus either a sulphonylurea or repaglinide, respectively) resulting in 6 stratification groups. Randomisation will not be carried out until after the baseline data have been collected.\n\nThe intervention group in Cohort 1 will be those randomised to metformin + Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122). The control group in Cohort 1 will be those randomised to receive metformin plus repaglinide, or a sulphonylurea or pioglitazone in line with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance as the preferred second-line therapy after metformin.\n\nThe intervention group in Cohort 2 will be those randomised to switch to metformin plus Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122). The control group in Cohort 2 will be those who continue with their current medication.\n\nThe study will recruit patients from both primary and secondary care in Leicester and Birmingham. It is envisaged to commence recruitment in February 2016, although this date is conditional upon on ethics committee and regulatory approval and necessary preparatory arrangements, including research governance approval at both sites. Actively recruitment will begin once all approvals are in place and after Sponsor 'green light' has been issued.\n\nRandomisation and Code breaking:- There will be six randomisation lists. Participant identifier numbers will be assigned sequentially as each subject enters the study. The participant will be assigned a study drug through a randomisation schedule based on the randomisation plan.\n\nRandomisation will be stratified by site and entry therapy (monotherapy OR dual therapy which includes metformin plus pioglitazone or metformin plus either a sulphonylurea or repaglinide) resulting in 6 groups using a variable block size of between 4 and 6. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to metformin + Canagliflozin (Invokana\u2122) or to metformin + a sulphonylurea, or continuation of their sulphonylurea, repaglinide or pioglitazone.\n\nDiscontinuation/Withdrawal of Participants from Study Treatment:- Each participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason and without any future care being affected. The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason. The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the case report form (CRF) and documented in the medical notes. If the participant is withdrawn due to an adverse event, the Investigator will arrange for follow-up visits or telephone calls until the adverse event has resolved, stabilised or concluded.\n\nSource Data:- Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which participants' CRF data are obtained. These include, but are not limited to, hospital records (from which medical history and previous and concurrent medication may be summarised into the CRF), clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. CRF entries will be considered source data if the CRF is the site of the original recording (e.g., there is no other written or electronic record of data). Specifically, for this study the CRF will be used as the source document for all anthropometrics, questionnaire and biochemistry that is collected during the study visits and copy of the biochemistry and anthropometric results will be put into the patient medical notes.\n\nDrug Management Storage of Study Treatment:- The local National Health Service (NHS) Trust pharmacies will supply the licensed products and will handle it according to their in-house protocols. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. All staff working on this study will have an up to date International Council for Harmonisation -Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) certificate.\n\nCompliance with Study Treatment:- The study will measure compliance by requesting participants to bring all unused or part-used medications and packaging from used medication at each visit. This will be recorded in the drug accountability log as part of the CRF. A participant who ceases to take their medication for up to two weeks will be considered 'non-compliant'. They will have the opportunity to re-initiate medication.\n\nAccountability of the Study Treatment:- The local NHS Trust pharmacies will dispense the study medication from their own stocks and they will also provide the appropriate drug labels. Returned and unused medication will be recorded by the research team and the research team will provide pharmacy with this medication at the end of the visit so that they can be destroyed in accordance with local regulations. Metformin will be prescribed as per usual by their General Practitioner (GP).\n\nConcomitant Medication:- Throughout the study, Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in the exclusion criteria. If the participant is subsequently prescribed excluded medication they will be withdrawn from the study.\n\nSAFETY REPORTING Please note the Sponsor of the Study (University of Leicester) and the Chief Investigator shall be responsible for complying with UK Competent Authority (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)) safety reporting requirements and be responsible for the participating (co- or sub-) investigators, as defined in the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nAs provided for in Article 3 of the Research Funding Agreement, the Sponsor and Chief Investigator will submit the safety information requested on the 'Clinical Serious Adverse Event Report' form (FRM-09210, Version 9.0) to the identified Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. representative of the country of origin, (i.e., Drug Safety Department of Janssen-Cilag Ltd) either by fax 01494 567799, or secure email and pdf to \"Dsafety@its.jnj.com\". For additional support, the Janssen-Cilag Ltd Drug Safety Department can be contacted on 01494 567 447.\n\nReporting Procedures for All Adverse Events (AEs):- All AEs occurring during the study observed by the investigator or reported by the participant, whether or not attributed to study medication, will be recorded on the CRF. The following information will be recorded, description, date of onset and end date, severity, assessment of relatedness to study medication, other suspect drug or device and action taken. Follow-up information will be provided as necessary.\n\nReporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs):- All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within one working day of discovery or notification of the event. The Sponsor will perform an initial check of the information and ensure that it is reviewed at the next R\\&D Management meeting. All SAE information must be recorded on an SAE form and sent to the Sponsor. Additional information received for a case (follow-up or corrections to the original case) needs to be detailed on a new SAE form and sent to the Sponsor.\n\nThe Sponsor will report all Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to the MHRA and the Research Ethics Committee (REC) concerned. Fatal or life-threatening SUSARs must be reported within 7 days and all other SUSARs within 15 days. The Chief Investigator will inform all investigators concerned of relevant information about SUSARs that could adversely affect the safety of participants. The Sponsor will use the Summary of Product Characteristics (SMPC) as the Reference Safety Information (RSI) when determining the expectedness of any untoward medical occurrences and thus SAE/SUSAR reporting.\n\nIn addition to the expedited reporting above, the Chief Investigator will submit once a year throughout the clinical study or on request a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) to the MHRA and REC.\n\nSTATISTICS Description of Statistical Methods:- Participants recruited to the study will be compared by randomised group with respect to both their baseline characteristics and their pre-Ramadan characteristics. Numbers (with percentages) for binary and categorical variables and means (and standard deviations), or medians (with lower and upper quartiles) for continuous variables will be presented. There will be no tests of statistical significance nor confidence intervals for differences between randomised groups on any baseline variable.\n\nThe primary outcome of this study is the achievement of the double composite endpoint of a reduction in HbA1c (\u2265 0.3%) and weight loss (\u22651kg) 3-4 weeks post-Ramadan.\n\nAll analyses of outcome data will be carried out on a complete case basis according to randomised group. As a sensitivity analysis, for the primary and main secondary outcome, multiple imputations will be used to perform an intention to treat analysis. The investigator will also conduct a per protocol analysis excluding those who report no longer taking their randomised treatment at the two follow-ups. All analyses will be performed assessing change during the following time periods:\n\n* Baseline to 3-4 post-Ramadan data constituting the primary analysis\n* Pre-Ramadan to 3-4 weeks post-Ramadan \u00b12 weeks\n* Baseline to 12 weeks post-Ramadan \u00b12 weeks\n* Baseline to 12 months post-baseline \u00b16 weeks The primary outcome will be analysed using logistic regression adjusted for the stratification factors (site, entry therapy ((1) monotherapy (2) dual therapy metformin plus pioglitazone (3) dual therapy metformin plus either a sulphonylurea or repaglinide)). The dependent variable will be defined as those achieving all of the composite end point targets. The same analysis method will be used for the secondary composite outcomes.\n\nThe biomedical outcomes will be analysed using linear regression adjusted for the stratification factors and baseline value. Ordinal regression will be used to compare treatment groups for the treatment satisfaction scores. Linear regression will be used for total metabolic equivalent (total METs).\n\nThe percentage of patients experiencing one or more self-reported hypoglycaemic events in their diaries (defined as a blood glucose level of \u22643.9 mmol/l) will be reported by group along with the median (Inter Quartile Range) number of episodes per patient. The incidence rate of hypoglycaemia per person year will be calculated per group and compared using the incidence rate ratio (IRR).\n\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) data will be collected at 3 time points. The mean proportion (%) of time spent either above (\u226510mmol/l), below (\u22643.1mmol/l) or within (3.2-9.9mmol/l) - which are our predefined glycaemic ranges - will be calculated for each participant over the recording period and adjusted for 24 hours. The study will compare these by treatment group for each time-point. The investigator will calculate change in proportion of time spent in each category from pre-Ramadan against during and against post-Ramadan within each group. The investigator will then compare any identified glycaemic shifts between treatment groups. The investigator will calculate the number of Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) low glucose events (\u22643.1 and \u22642.2mmol/L) and CGM high glucose events (\u226510.0mmol/L) within each treatment group and determine if the incidence changes across the three time points.\n\nThe Number of Participants:- The sample size required to detect a minimum clinical significant difference of 27.7% in those achieving the primary outcome between the treatment arms is 116 participants (n=58 per group), with 80% power and an alpha of 5%, assuming a dropout rate of 20%. This is based on 21.2% of the SU plus metformin group in the 'Treat 4 Ramadan study' having met the proposed primary outcome of achieving the double composite endpoint of a reduction in HbA1c (\u22650.3%) and weight loss (\u2265 1kg) 3-4 weeks post-Ramadan.\n\nThe Level of Statistical Significance:- All analyses will be carried out in Stata (version 12.0) 95% confidence intervals will be reported with p\\<0.05 relating to statistical significance.\n\nProcedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data:- Data will be entered into a database with real-time validation, which will limit spurious data. Before analysis begins all data will be checked and any anomalies will be checked against the source data.\n\nDuring data collection the study team will attempt to minimise missing data items. Participants with missing data will be excluded on a case-wise basis, i.e., only from those analyses which required the missing items. The primary and main secondary outcomes will be analysed on both a complete case basis and using multiple imputation to estimate the effect of missing data.\n\nQUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES A monitoring plan will be developed by the Sponsor in accordance with Sponsor Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The monitoring plan will be based on a study risk assessment which is determined by the level of risk within the study to participant safety and data integrity and validity; monitoring will be carried out by monitoring staff employed by the Sponsor.\n\nThe Leicester Diabetes Centre in conjunction with the Leicester Clinical Trials Unit will be responsible for all elements of study management on an ongoing basis. For example, the CRFs will be checked for completeness at the end of a measurement session and any data queries will be raised with the research nurse who recorded the data in the first instance. Repeated errors will be referred to the Senior Research Team Manager who will instigate training. The study monitor will remain external to the study team thereby ensuring independence during the sponsor monitoring process. All in-house monitoring and audit will be performed by staff who are ICH/GCP trained and are competent in monitoring to GCP standards. A documented monitoring log and audit trail will be maintained throughout the lifetime of the study.\n\nThe Trial Manager in conjunction with the Clinical Trials Unit will oversee the set-up of and conduct of study procedures at each site. All source data, study documents, medical notes will be made available for Sponsor monitoring, and any external audits and inspections as appropriate, for example by the MHRA or Research Ethics Committee.\n\nSTUDY GOVERNANCE Trial Steering Committee (TSC):- TSC will comprise an independent chair, at least one other independent clinician with expertise in the management of diabetes, the chief investigator, key co-investigators, and representation from the Leicester Clinical Trials Unit. The study statisticians may attend as needed. This committee will be responsible for the overall management and oversight of the study and will meet once prior to start up and then every 6 months, normally within 2 months of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) (although additional meetings may be called by the Chief Investigator or TSC or DSMC chair) to review and approve protocol amendments and any sub-study proposals, review recruitment rates, protocol adherence, retention, compliance, safety issues, planned analyses and reports and act on recommendations of the DSMC. A copy of meeting minutes will be sent to the Sponsor.\n\nData Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC):- DSMC will comprise an independent chair, independent clinician and independent statistician. The chief investigator or study statistician may be invited to attend to provide specific input by the DSMC Chair. The DSMC will be responsible for the interests and safety of the participants and its main role will be to make advisory recommendations to the TSC who will report to the Sponsor. To this end, the DSMC will undertake safety data reviews every six months after the first 5 participants are recruited unless otherwise deemed necessary. In addition, the DSMC will review analysis plans.\n\nProject Management Committee (PMC):- PMC will report to the TSC and will include the chief investigator, other senior investigators and the day-to-day project management team. The group will meet monthly or bi-monthly depending on need, either face-to-face or by teleconference, to discuss the details and logistics of recruitment, retention and follow-up data collection.",

    "detailed_description": "In people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), weight loss is associated with improved glycaemic control and markers of cardiometabolic function as well as reduced use of antidiabetic medicine. Beyond pharmacological treatments, current strategies to reduce body weight and improve glycaemia include energy-restricted diets and increased physical activity.\n\nLifestyle interventions are complex, affecting many aspects of peoples' daily life. Dietary restrictions often result in rapid weight loss, but the weight is gradually regained by many. Barriers to implement and maintain dietary changes include lack of knowledge, support, and insights into the type and amount of foods eaten. Previous lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss in T2D show efficacy for improving markers of metabolic risk, including weight and glycaemia during the intervention, but relapse of behavior and weight regain are often present.\n\nOne reason may be that the intervention is not modified according to the needs of the target group. Often, weight loss interventions are shaped by a 'one size fits all' model where both individual capabilities and motivation as well as social and contextual factors are more or less ignored. A user-based design will facilitate enrolment of participants and likely promote uptake and maintenance of the intervention among participants.\n\nIntermittent fasting regimens have been suggested as efficient strategies for improving cardiometabolic health to a greater extent than can be attributed to the reduction in energy intake alone. Time-restricted eating limits the time available for food intake to typically 4-10 hours/day without other dietary restrictions and has been put forward as a novel, acceptable, and safe lifestyle modification and has shown promising effects on body weight, glucose metabolism, appetite, and cardiometabolic health in individuals at high risk of T2D.\n\nThe overall aim of this pilot study is to examine feasibility of a 12-week 10-hour time-restricted eating based intervention in individuals with overweight or obesity and T2D. Participants will attend visit 1 (baseline), visit 2 (8 weeks after baseline) and visit 3 (12 weeks after baseline). The study consists of 8 weeks of strict time-restricted eating, followed by 4 weeks of individually adjusted time-restricted eating.\n\nSpecific aims are:\n\n1. To assess adherence and participants' experiences, needs and barriers with an 8-week strict time-restricted eating period, followed by a 4-week period with an individually adjusted time-restricted eating based intervention\n2. To examine whether intervention components are delivered by health care professionals as intended\n3. To explore if intervention support components are acceptable, useful and sufficient for the participants\n4. To study recruitment processes and retention, and related barriers and facilitators\n5.

People with learning disabilities may also be prescribed drugs or have certain medical conditions (such as Down's syndrome) which can make their chances of getting diabetes greater.\n\nDiabetes is a long-term condition, which can cause damage to the eyes, heart, kidneys, nerves and feet. Impaired glucose regulation happens when sugar levels in the blood are higher than normal but are not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. People with impaired glucose regulation are more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke in the future. If people with impaired glucose regulation make changes to their lifestyle (diet and exercise) they can prevent or delay getting diabetes.\n\nThe aim of this study is to screen people with learning disabilities for diabetes and impaired glucose regulation. The investigators also want to find out the best way to give people with learning disabilities some education around healthy lifestyles (for example, eating and exercise) to help with prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the investigators also aim to develop a lifestyle education programme that is suitable for use in this population and test whether it is feasible and acceptable.",
    "detailed_description": "Background -Adults with learning (intellectual) disabilities tend to have more health problems than the general population and are less likely to access help. Additionally, evidence suggests that due to a combination of lifestyle factors (e.g. poor diet, lack of physical activity), associated medical problems, and certain types of prescribed medication, people with learning disabilities may be at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our overall aim is to undertake a programme of research that improves our knowledge and understanding of screening for impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes in a population with learning disabilities, and to develop a lifestyle education programme for prevention of type 2 diabetes that is suitable for use in this population.\n\nSCREENING PROGRAMME\n\nAim - The main programme of work consists of a large diabetes screening programme. The primary aim of the screening study is to evaluate the feasibility and clinical and cost effectiveness of a screening programme for identifying undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation that is suitable for use in a population with learning disabilities.\n\nMethods - A variety of approaches will be used to recruit people to the screening study: General practices will be approached first for participation in this study. If the practice does not agree, then the investigators will seek to approach eligible people on the Leicestershire Learning Disabilities Register. Learning disabilities consultants will also approach people face to face when attending for outpatient clinic appointments. Additionally, if individuals with learning disabilities (and/or their carer) contact the STOP Diabetes team to express an interest in the study, they will be given an invitation.\n\n* Volunteers will be asked to attend an appointment(s) where consent will be obtained and biomedical and demographic data collected. The consent process and data collection will be staged and people may need to attend between one to three appointments to complete.\n* People who are found to have type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose regulation will be asked to see their GP for care.\n* At every stage, reasonable adjustments will be made to take into account people's communication needs and decision making capacity. This may include involving a carer or a\n\nDEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A STRUCTURED EDUCATION PROGRAMME\n\nThe aims of additional work being carried out alongside the screening study are to: (1) develop a lifestyle education programme to meet the needs of a population with learning disabilities and impaired glucose regulation or high risk of diabetes; (2) assess the feasibility of collecting outcome measures for participants with learning disabilities before and 3-months after they attend the education programme.\n\nMethods - People approached to take part will be people who took part in the screening study and (1) gave their consent to be approached to take part in further phases of the research programme, and (2) were found to be at increased risk of developing diabetes according to their screening results.\n\nQualitative Interviews to inform curriculum development:\n\n* Interviews will be conducted with a sample of people with mild/moderate learning disabilities, their carers and healthcare professionals. Findings from the interviews will help inform development of an initial curriculum and education program.\n\nDelivery of initial curriculum and obtaining feedback:\n\n* As part of the development work the education programme will be piloted with at least two groups of 6 - 8 people plus carers. Feedback will be collected from some of the people who attend the education sessions and any necessary changes made to the curriculum. These cycles of piloting, collecting feedback and modifying the programme will be repeated until the education programme developed is \"fit for purpose\".\n\nDelivery of programme with collection of before and after measures:\n\n* Following initial development, testing and refinement of the curriculum, the education programme will be delivered with another sample of participants and the feasibility of collecting pre and post intervention outcome measures will be tested. The investigators anticipate delivering the programme to up to two groups of 6 - 8 people plus carers. Data will be collected at baseline and 3-months (12 weeks) following delivery of the final education session. Data and may include: physical activity and sedentary behaviour (as measured by accelerometer); body weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure and dietary intake (fruit and vegetables). Uptake of the education programme (attendance) and retention at 3-months follow-up will also be explored. This phase will be subject to modification depending on the findings from prior iterations and any problems encountered.",

Research Design\n\nThis is a double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 120 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. These 120 will be randomly assigned treatments utilizing Photon Therapy, using a defined treatment protocol. We expect that some patients will drop out, and our goal is 100 treated patients, for statistical purposes. The Photon Therapy group will be split into two groups, one group that receives Active Photon Therapy and one group that will be treated with the same type of equipment that has been modified to emit no infrared photons (Non Active Photon Therapy Group (\"Placebo\")). The patients in the \"Non Active Photon Therapy Group\" will be offered an Active Photon Treatment Session after completion of the study. The patients in the Photon Therapy Groups will be randomized. There will also be an Historical Control Group of patients, fifty, will have received traditional medical interventions (e.g., narcotics, seizure medications) in traditional medical practices.

We have collected data on nerve function, pain, quality of life, and skin circulation. The data will remain stored until the study is complete to preserve the blinded nature of the project. Data analysis is still incomplete.\n\n4\\. Clinical Significance\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is a chronic and progressive condition that potentially leads to disabling pain, and worse, amputation, for many individuals in the United States each year. Present treatments utilize antiseizure medications, opiate analgesics, and antidepressants, and are inconsistently effective. Development of a new treatment strategy potentially could have significant benefit for a great many patients.",

In October 2004, we received permission to post flyers and solicit patients (identified by Dr Beckley) from primary providers (flyer and letter attached). We also recruited by posting flyers in VANCHCS facilities, and with VANCHCS diabetes educators. Word of mouth also provided many subjects. In September 2006 we modified the flyer to reflect a focused recruitment at Mather. Vulnerable populations will not be studied.\n* RISKS: The potential risks to subjects include physical, psychological, social and economic. These are not likely: The physical risks include discomfort from the photon machine. The psychological risks include boredom. The social risks include being labeled as having a chronic illness, and the risk of loss of privacy. The economic risk includes time off from work that may be needed to participate in the treatment program. Confidentiality will be maintained as much as possible, by storing paper data in locked offices, without name identifiers, and electronic data on spreadsheets on password-protected computers in locked offices.\n* BENEFITS: Individual subjects may derive benefit via pain relief; this would also obtain to the whole group of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.\n* RISK-BENEFIT RATIO: The risk is minimal, and the benefit minimal to moderate (potentially greater).\n* SAFETY MONITORING: Research staff will monitor for safety.\n* INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES: The PI (Dr. Swislocki) and his staff (Ms. Orth, Ms. Weisshaupt) will conduct, obtain, and document informed consent within VANCHCS facilities.\n* PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS: Confidentiality will be maintained as much as possible, by storing paper data in locked offices, without name identifiers, and electronic data on spreadsheets on password-protected computers in locked offices.\n* COSTS TO SUBJECTS: No added expenses are expected.

    "brief_summary": "It is well established that alterations in the portal vein insulin:glucagon ratio play a major role in the dysregulated hepatic glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes but the molecular mechanism by which glucagon promotes alterations in hepatic glucose production and mitochondrial oxidation remain poorly understood. This is borne out of the fact that both glucagon agonists and antagonists are being developed to treat type 2 diabetes with unclear mechanisms of action.\n\nThis study will directly assess rates of mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux for the first time in humans using PINTA analysis as well as the effects of glucagon. The results will have important implications for the possibility of intervening in the pathogenesis of non alcoholic fatty liver and type 2 diabetes via chronic dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor antagonism and provide an important rationale for why a dual agonist may be more efficacious for treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver and T2D than GLP-1 alone.",
    "detailed_description": "Objectives:\n\nTo examine rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in healthy volunteers with liver lipid less than 2%.\n\nTo examine the effects of glucagon on hepatic glucose and fat metabolism in vivo, this study will apply a novel Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) method to quantify rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux, which has been cross-validated in awake rodents and humans (Perry et al. Nature Communications 2017). Preliminary rodent studies have found that glucagon stimulates intrahepatic lipolysis through an InsP3R-I-dependent process, leading to increases in hepatic acetyl-CoA content, which allosterically activates pyruvate carboxylase activity and flux, and that this phenomenon explains its acute, transcription-independent effect to acutely stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo (unpublished results). In addition, using PINTA analysis it has been shown that glucagon stimulates hepatic mitochondrial oxidation through calcium signaling in awake mice, and that this process can be exploited by short-term continuous glucagon treatment leading to two-fold increases in hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation, which in turn results in large reductions in hepatic steatosis and marked improvements in glucose tolerance through reversal of hepatic insulin resistance in a high fat fed rat model of non alcoholic fatty liver.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n1\\. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase in rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation in healthy humans.\n\n3\\. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase in rates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux in healthy humans.\n\n4\\. A physiological increase in plasma glucagon concentrations will promote a significant increase in rates of 13C4 \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate turnover (hepatic ketogenesis) in healthy humans.\n\nStudy Design - Clinical Plan:\n\nThe effects of a physiological increase in plasma glucagon on rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and pyruvate carboxylase flux will be examined in a group of up to 12 healthy participants (ages 21-65) using Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) (Perry et al. Nature Communication 2017). Briefly rates of hepatic mitochondrial oxidation and hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux will be assessed in 12 healthy overnight fasted participants by PINTA after a three-hour infusion of glucagon or saline. The glucagon infusion will be designed to increase peripheral and portal vein plasma glucagon concentrations 3-4 fold. The effects of a physiological increase in plasma glucagon on rates of hepatic ketogenesis will also be assessed using an infusion of 13C4 \u03b2-betahydroxybutyrate (Perry et al. Cell Metabolism 2017).\n\nRates of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase flux /citrate synthase flux by PINTA: Participants (n=12) will be studied by PINTA under 2 conditions: 1) following an overnight fast and a 3 hour saline infusion (Control), 2) following an overnight fast and a 3 hour glucagon infusion. Briefly, after collection of baseline blood samples a 3 hour infusion of tracers as described below will be started. Relative rates of pyruvate carboxylase to citrate synthesis flux will be assessed using a constant infusion of \\[3-13C\\] lactate and rates of glucose production will be measured using an infusion of \\[2H7\\]glucose (Perry et al. Nature Communication 2017). Rates of hepatic ketogenesis will be measured using a constant infusion of \\[3C \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate as previously described (Perry et al. Cell Metabolism 2017).\n\nWhole body energy expenditure and the respiratory quotient will be assessed by indirect calorimetry.",

    "brief_summary": "Increasing rates of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents has considerable long-term implications not only for the affected individuals, but also for society and the health system as a whole. Pediatricians have unique and important opportunities to screen for type 2 diabetes and to promote lifestyle modification for those children identified with pre-diabetes; yet implementation of these practices within the pediatric primary care setting is far from ideal. The purpose of this study is to implement the ADA screening guidelines for type 2 diabetes and clinical management prompts within a pediatric primary care setting using a computer decision support system (CDSS) developed by the investigators research group - the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. The investigators hypothesize that the coupling of CDSS with ADA guidelines will result in greater compliance with ADA recommended screening procedures as well as better clinical management of children identified as having pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes.",
    "detailed_description": "As the prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen, so too has the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, a disease typically associated with adults. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended screening children 10 years of age or older who are at substantial risk for the presence or development of type 2 diabetes. They also recommend that primary prevention efforts, such as lifestyle modification, be directed to high-risk children whose glucose levels are elevated but not yet diagnostic of diabetes. The choice of screening methodology remains controversial and implementation within the pediatric primary care setting is far from ideal. The purpose of this study is to implement the ADA screening guidelines for type 2 diabetes within pediatric primary care practices using a computer decision support system (CDSS) developed by the investigators research group - the Child Health Improvement through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. Using the CHICA system the investigators will also be implementing clinical management prompts for the pediatrician caring for children with risk factors for type 2 diabetes, with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or with fasting glucose indicating the possibility of diabetes. One of the greatest strengths of the CHICA system is its ability to implement evidence-based recommendations from authoritative sources, in this case the ADA, in a format that integrates easily into routine pediatric care; the system can therefore overcome many of the barriers described by pediatricians to the screening of type 2 diabetes in children. While the use of CDSS is not new, its application within the pediatric population has not been as pervasive as in adult medicine. Moreover, the application of CDSS to the screening, diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes in children is relatively unexplored. The specific aims for this study are to: (1) Expand and modify an existing computer-based decision support system (CHICA), to identify those children 10 years of age or older who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, to provide pediatric physicians guidelines to screen for type 2 diabetes, and to coordinate the diagnosis and long-term management of the condition and (2) Demonstrate both the feasibility and effectiveness of the CHICA Type 2 Diabetes Module to recognize those children in need of screening for type 2 diabetes and facilitate prompt diagnosis and management of the condition. Phase one (Aim 1) focuses on programming and enhancements to the CHICA system and will take 12 months to complete. Phase two consists of a randomized controlled trial conducted in four pediatric clinics in order to evaluate Aim 2. Randomization will be by clinic and the investigators hypothesize that the coupling of CDSS with ADA guidelines will result in greater compliance with ADA recommended screening procedures as well as better clinical management of children identified as having pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Phase two will begin in year 2 and continue through quarter 2 of year 4. Phase three involves statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.",

    "brief_summary": "For children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), pain and needle phobia can cause postponing of changes in insulin pump infusion sets and continuous glucose monitors, and thus worsen glycemic control. We aim to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) technology, in reducing pain and anxiety, and improving regimen adherence and glycemic control among children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).\n\nChildren with T1D, managed with continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps, will be recruited for a randomized cross-over trial. Children will be randomized to one of two interventions for diabetes management: group 1 will use VR glasses first and group 2 will listen to vocal-guided affective imagery first (audio). After 1 month, the interventions will be crossed over. The outcome measures will include pain and anxiety assessment, regimen adherence, glycemic control, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of VR satisfaction and effectiveness.",
    "detailed_description": "Children with T1D aged 8 to 15 years old, managed with CGM and insulin pumps, will be screened for participation. Key exclusion criteria include medical conditions that precluded use of the VR tool, such as epilepsy or vertigo, and diagnosed anxiety disorder.\n\nChildren will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to one of the two groups. Upon every change of a CGM or pump infusion set, parents will be instructed to actively coach the child to use the designated intervention, VR glasses, or vocal-guided affective imagery, during the entire procedure. The VR glasses will be \"PICO\" model neo 2. The visual and vocal data content include both calming, affective imagery and interactive gaming, supplied by \"XR-Health Israel Ltd\". The vocal-guided affective imagery during the procedure will be identical to the vocal guide in the VR glasses. We plan 40 children in each group. The study will last for 2 months.\n\nQuestionnaires to assess anxiety and pain will be given to the children at baseline, during every CGM / pump infusion set change (every 3-14 days, depending on the device), and at one and two months after study initiation. Regimen adherence will be measured by changes in the number of insertion sites on the participants' bodies and by their willingness to change CGM / pump infusion sets themselves. Questionnaires administered at baseline, one month, and two months after the intervention will assess the use of aiding measures. Glycemic control measures that will be measured are comprised of differences between the interventions, in the percentage of time in range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dL, the percentage of time below range I (TBRI) \\<70 mg/dL and TBRII \\<54 mg/dL, the percentage of time above range I (TARI) \\>180 mg/dL andTARII \\>250 mg/dL, estimated HbA1c as measured by glucose management indicator (GMI), mean glucose, standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation (CV). A questionnaire that will assess the effectiveness and satisfaction of VR, and will evaluate the relief of diabetes distress following the intervention will be given at baseline, 1 and 2 months after the beginning.",

    "detailed_description": "The Bronx has the heaviest burden of diabetes within New York City (NYC) and statewide. The highest diabetes hospitalization and death rates in NYC occur in the Bronx, which has hospitalization rates approximately 25 percent above the statewide average. The Bronx is one of the poorest urban counties in the nation, and diabetes disproportionately impacts high-poverty communities. The borough has an ethnically and racially diverse population (53.5% of residents are Hispanic and 36.5% are black), and diabetes is highly prevalent among blacks and Hispanics. Obesity, a major risk factor for diabetes, is also prevalent with nearly 33% (much higher than the 24% prevalence of obesity in NYC) of Bronx adults being obese. Among the many social determinants of health, medical provider practice behaviors, suboptimal access to health care, lack of patient knowledge regarding proper medication administration and potential side effects, and difficulty adhering to medical regimens by patients and families all contribute to poor diabetes outcomes.\n\nWith appropriate medical care including education (especially regarding potentially modifiable lifestyle factors that contribute to diabetes), well-informed patients can achieve diabetes control. However, there are significant challenges in providing effective patient education in the ambulatory setting, such as time constraints and prioritizing other issues (e.g. comorbid conditions) above comprehensive diabetes education. While patient education and teaching self-management skills are critical to improve diabetes outcomes, such strategies will succeed only as part of more comprehensive interventions. Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has been linked to decreases in hemoglobin A1c, reductions in the onset and/or progression of diabetes complications, reductions in diabetes-related hospitalizations and readmissions, and improvements in quality of life, lifestyle behaviors (e.g. physical activity, healthier eating), self-efficacy, and coping skills. The American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) has described the AADE7 Self-Care Behaviors (healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medications, problem solving, healthy coping, reducing risks) as a framework to organize and structure patient-centered education. Despite the proven benefits of DSME, less than 10% of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients receive structured education for a variety of reasons: providers' misunderstanding of DSME effectiveness and confusion about how to make referrals; many clinic sites' lack of access to DSME services; and some payers' lack of coverage for DSME services. With the increasing use of smartphones and the internet, health information technology (IT)-based approaches (e.g. mobile applications, text messaging platforms, internet-based educational modules, and telemedicine/telehealth interventions) - through standalone interventions or by supplementing education (i.e. by reinforcing content delivered in-person) - can increase patients' access to DSME, and have been linked to improvements in hemoglobin A1c and other outcomes. Mobile applications ('apps') can provide day-to-day support for patients with diabetes, but commonly lack evidence-based content and/or comprehensiveness. A recent study reported that only a small percentage of the diabetes apps available on the iOS and Android stores supported the AADE7 behaviors regarding problem solving, healthy coping, and reducing risks. Another recent article suggested that few apps provided personalized education or tailored therapeutic support. As with other chronic conditions, diabetes mobile applications are often characterized by low retention rates and decreased user engagement with the app following the initial download.\n\nGiven the need for personalizable and adaptive mobile applications for patients with type 2 diabetes, this proposal will develop, evaluate, and refine a patient-centered mobile application (T2DXcel), which will deliver tailored and algorithm-based diabetes education to improve process and diabetes-related outcomes.",

    "detailed_description": "Intraperitoneal islet transplantation has the potential to ameliorate type 1 diabetes mellitus and avert the long-term consequences of chronic diabetes which cannot be achieved by conventional insulin treatment.\n\nAs donor human islets are not available in sufficient numbers, porcine islets are the best alternative source as they are recognised as the most physiologically compatible xenogeneic insulin-producing cells. Although the use of pig-derived cells raises the risk of xenotic infections, this can be minimised by obtaining cells from designated pathogen-free (DPF) animals bred in isolation and monitored to be free of specified pathogens. The worldwide experience to date in more than 200 patients who have received transplants of pig tissue has not demonstrated evidence of transmitted xenotic infections.\n\nAs animal-derived tissues have to be protected from immune rejection when transplanted into humans, transplants are usually accompanied by immunosuppressive therapy. However, porcine islets are preferably transplanted without the use of immunosuppressive drugs which cause significant morbidity. To protect them from immune rejection, the islets can be encapsulated in alginate microcapsules which permit the inward passage of nutrients and glucose and the outward passage of insulin. Alginate-encapsulated porcine islets transplanted without immunosuppressive drugs have survived rejection for many months in animal studies.\n\nDIABECELL comprises neonatal porcine islets encapsulated in alginate microcapsules. DIABECELL has been safely transplanted in healthy and diabetic mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and non-human primates. Following DIABECELL transplants, the requirement for daily insulin was significantly reduced in diabetic rats and non-human primates.\n\nThe optimal dose and frequency of transplantation of the current DIABECELL preparation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in humans can only be determined in clinical trials. The intention of this phase IIb clinical trial is to obtain at least 52 weeks safety and preliminary efficacy data in type 1 diabetic patients following transplantation of two effective doses of DIABECELL into the peritoneal cavity.",

To determine the change in metabolic control in type 2 diabetic individuals when three days of bed rest is compared to three days of activity;\n2. To determine the rate of progression of the deterioration in metabolic control and the magnitude of the decrease;\n3.

To compare the effects of 48 hours of bed rest on orthostatic responses in type 2 diabetic patients, and healthy non-diabetics.\n6. To make recommendations to the diabetic community to prevent metabolic deterioration during a 3 day hospitalization.",
    "detailed_description": "The goal for all diabetic patients is to maintain their metabolic control as close to normal as possible to prevent the short and long term complications of diabetes. Surgery of any type presents a unique challenge to the diabetic patient because two factors tend to worsen their metabolic control 1) the stress of the actual surgery and 2) the bed rest that follows the surgery. Data has clearly shown that surgery increase counter regulatory hormones (epinephrine, glucagon, growth hormone and cortisol). What has not been studied is the effect of bed rest per se on metabolic control. This is surprising because there are many studies in normal healthy people demonstrating that simple bed rest increases insulin resistance and worsens metabolic control.\n\nThe proposed study will define the metabolic effects of simple, three-day bed rest on metabolic control in healthy type 2 diabetic volunteers while evaluating the orthostatic response after bed rest. All studies will be done in the inpatient, General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). All volunteers will stop their oral antidiabetic medication before they enter the GCRC. They will be placed on intravenous insulin to prevent severe metabolic deterioration and hyperglycemia. The amount of insulin we have to give them to maintain metabolic control will be one measure of the effects of bed rest on metabolic control.\n\nExperimental Design and Methods.\n\nA crossover study in twenty healthy normal and twenty healthy type 2 diabetic subjects will be utilized. Each subject will be admitted the the GCRC the night prior to beginning the study in order to insure metabolic stability at the start of the protocol. Each subject will stay in the GCRC three full days (three nights) from the time of admission. Each subject will be admitted on two separate occasions, separated by at least a two week interval. A diagram of the protocol is given below:\n\nThe primary difference between the two admissions will be the amount of physical activity allowed each subject. On the normal physical activity GCRC admission, the subject will be encouraged to stay our of bed until his/her usual bedtime. All procedures and meals will take place in the GCRC but in between times the subject will be encouraged to walk around the hospital and to carry out normal activities of daily living. On the bed rest GCRC admission, the subjects will be encouraged to stay in bed as much as possible and to use a bedside commode. A tilt test was performed on the morning of the first day of each hospitalization and again 48 hours later. The same testing will be done as in the normal activity admission.\n\nAll medications that the volunteer usually takes at home will be continued in the hospital.\n\nThe volunteer will be in the GCRC for three days: Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3. The following tests will be done on the three days:\n\nDay 1 - Blood will drawn for fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide as well as surrogate markers of atherosclerosis including PAI-1, IL-6, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and CRP. In addition, a tilt table test will be done to assess autonomic response to activity or bedrest.\n\nDay 2 - Blood will drawn for fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide as well as surrogate markers of atherosclerosis including PAI-1, IL-6, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and CRP.\n\nDay 3 - Blood will drawn for fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, and C-peptide as well as surrogate markers of atherosclerosis including PAI-1, IL-6, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and CRP.

In all of these studies, the telemedicine group scheduled more contacts with the health care professionals than in the standard care group. To the investigator's knowledge, no one has investigated telemedicine, compared to standard care with the same number of scheduled contacts.

This may result in some patients choosing not to start or not being offered insulin pump treatment despite indications that an insulin pump is an optimal treatment choice. The challenge of distance also poses problems for patients in relation to technical problems or medical issues with the insulin pump. Telemedicine should be a solution for both patients and their Health Care Providers.\n\nIn this randomised controlled study, the effects of conducting clinical visits remotely, for patients living with insulin pumps will be investigated.

In addition, weight gain may adversely affect the control of comorbid health conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, etc.). The burden of disease management with multiple daily injections of insulin also serves as a barrier to A1C goal attainment as maintaining compliance with such complex regimens is often challenging in the real-world setting.\n\nOnce patients with T2D require multiple daily injections of insulin to obtain glycemic control, it is generally considered to be a permanent/life-long therapy. However, reports have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of adding once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) liraglutide to basal insulin therapy in order to obtain glycemic control (1, 2), and in clinical practice, the addition of liraglutide (or other FDA-approved GLP-1RAs) to basal insulin often negates or delays the need to initiate prandial insulin. Subsequently, a newer form of anti-diabetic therapy, a once-daily injectable combination of GLP-1RA and basal insulin, became available and demonstrated promise that perhaps glycemic control may even be obtained with less complex regimens (i.e., less daily injections). There are currently two GLP-1RA/basal insulin combination therapies that are FDA approved: iGlarLixi (Soliqua\u00ae), and iDegLira (Xultophy\u00ae) (3, 4). While these observations with iGlarLixi and iDegLira demonstrating an improvement in A1C while avoiding prandial insulin injections are very exciting, what remains unclear is if patients with reasonable glycemic control (A1C \u2264 7.5%) currently receiving MDI (basal/bolus, 3-4 injections per day) could potentially maintain or even improve glycemic control by switching to a once-daily injectable product like Xultophy\u00ae or Soliqua\u00ae. Currently, there are no studies available (or planned) that have answered this clinical question. One limitation of these combination products in the clinical setting is the inability to independently titrate the GLP-1RA and basal insulin components. If a patient begins to experience hypoglycemia, and/or their fasting BG values are currently within the goal range, the dose of these combination products cannot be further titrated, limiting one's ability to further improve glycemic control in patients with a residual A1C elevation.\n\nWhat also remains unclear is if some of the newer formulations of GLP-1RA may also be able to reduce the burden of disease management and maintain glycemic control in patients who are currently well-controlled on a regimen of MDI. Recently, subcutaneous (sc) once-weekly semaglutide has been demonstrated to be capable of improving glycemic control in patients with T2D in combination with insulin therapy. In SUSTAIN-5 (5), at week 30, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg was demonstrated to reduce A1C by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively, vs 0.1% with placebo \\[mean baseline A1C value, 8.4%\\] in a population of T2D patients receiving stable therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin. Moreover, mean body weight (kg) decreased with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo from baseline to end of treatment: 3.7, 6.4, and 1.4 kg, respectively. Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was higher for semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo (4.5%, 6.1%, and 0.8%), mainly due to gastrointestinal disorders. Even if the transition from MDI to once-daily sc semaglutide in combination with basal insulin were successful in only a minority of patients, the clinical advantage and reduction in burden of disease management that would be associated with transitioning from 3-4 injections of insulin per day to a regimen of once- weekly sc semaglutide and a once-daily injection of basal insulin would be a rather dramatic and remarkable transformation for patients, and one that would likely improve patients' diabetes treatment satisfaction. It would also help to solidify the effectiveness and safety of semaglutide in yet another population of patients with T2D. What cannot be minimized is the tremendous impact that a successful transition to once-weekly semaglutide and once-daily basal insulin could have on patients in terms of reducing their insulin requirements, assisting with weight loss (or mitigating further weight gain), and reducing the frequency and burden of hypoglycemia. In my clinical experience, once patients are titrated to full dose GLP-1RA therapy and attain adequate glycemic control, insulin doses (particularly prandial insulin) can often be further reduced or eliminated without negatively impacting glycemic control. Continuing the insulin therapy at higher doses in these patients simply suppresses the glucose-dependent secretion of endogenous insulin being promoted by the GLP-1RA therapy. Often, only an abrupt cessation of prandial insulin, or a step-wise down-titration of insulin therapy in these patients, will reveal that insulin therapy is no longer required at higher doses to maintain glycemic control. When this does successfully occur, the impact on patients is transformational.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of once-weekly sc semaglutide (in combination with once-daily basal insulin) to maintain or improve glycemic control in patients currently receiving MDI, while providing the patients with a significant reduction in the burden of disease management. In addition, this approach may also furnish a positive effect on weight management, a reduction in hypoglycemic episodes, and improvement in diabetes treatment satisfaction, when substituted for basal/bolus therapy in patients with T2D who currently have adequate glycemic control (A1C \u2264 7.5%) with a regimen of MDI (requiring a total of \u2264 80 units of insulin per day). The A1C cut-point of \u2264 7.5% was chosen because many patients on complex treatment regimens (MDI) with reasonable control, i.e., 7-7.5%, would be expected to have a realistic chance of success by switching from MDI to sc semaglutide and basal insulin combination therapy. Also, many patients taking complex insulin regimens (MDI) fall in the close to A1C goal range of 7-7.5%, so using this cut-point, vs. \\< 7%, would make recruitment easier. Lastly, patients receiving MDI who are older and/or with heart disease also have higher individual A1C goal/targets around 7.5%. This study will also assess the impact that a successful substitution may have on the patients' diabetes treatment satisfaction, an important, yet under-appreciated aspect of diabetes management.",

    "brief_summary": "This study is part of a research project for a University MD Program. This is an observational study aimed at comparing the differences in bone metabolism and microcirculation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (with and without diabetic neuropathy and Charcot foot) with healthy subjects.\n\nDiabetes is gradually becoming a global epidemic along with its associated complications. Diabetes can affect several systems in our body particularly the eyes, nerves and the kidneys. The damaging effects occur at the level of the small blood vessels (microcirculation) that supply these vital structures. Normally, the inner lining of these blood vessels (endothelium) plays a very important role in maintaining adequate blood flow. The endothelium releases a chemical substance called nitric oxide, which relaxes these small blood vessels thereby ensuring sufficient blood supply to these key structures. Nitric oxide also prevents blockage of these vessels. Any form of metabolic stress like hyperglycaemia (raised blood sugar as seen in diabetes) can cause abnormal changes in the normal behaviour of the endothelium (endothelial dysfunction). Therefore hyperglycaemia promotes endothelial dysfunction by lowering nitric oxide levels, which may lead to diabetic complications like diabetic retinopathy (eye damage), nephropathy (kidney damage) or neuropathy (nerve damage).\n\nIn addition, patients with diabetes also suffer from osteoporosis (thinning of bones). Osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterised by a reduction in bone mineral content leading to an increased risk of developing fractures. The increased risk of fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes is attributed to poor bone quality resulting from the harmful effects of high blood glucose. Studies have also shown that nitric oxide has a bone protective effect as demonstrated by its ability to prevent bone fragmentation and improve bone strength.\n\nStudy of markers of endothelial function and bone metabolism will facilitate a better understanding about the origin of diabetic complications. This will aid in the development of novel therapeutic agents that target the harmful triggers in diabetes and eventually may prevent and retard the onset of the debilitating diabetic complications.",
    "detailed_description": "This is an observational study aimed at observing and comparing differences in bone metabolism and microcirculation in patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy controls.\n\nIn this study, 50 participants will be recruited and then categorised into the following groups:\n\n1.

The duration of the study is 5 months.\n\nScreening (-2 Weeks): To assess for eligibility. This will include informed consent process, medical history and physical examination, screening for neuropathy and routine bloods. Laboratory work-up done at screening will be considered for data analysis.\n\nVisit 1 - Baseline visit\n\n* Anthropometric measures: Height, weight, BMI, waist circumference\n* Vital parameters: supine and standing blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and temperature\n* Laboratory assessment that includes markers of endothelial activation, inflammation and bone metabolism.\n\n  * Markers of endothelial activation will be investigated using systemic protein suspension array technology.

In this trial the skin microcirculation will be measured on the dorsum of the foot using a Perimed Laser Doppler imager and iontophoresis system.\n\nEndothelial-mediated vasodilation will be measured by the iontophoresis of acetylcholine, while sodium nitroprusside will be used to measure endothelium-independent vasodilation. The iontophoresis system consists of an ION chamber (iontophoresis delivery vehicle device) that sticks firmly to the skin and a reference electrode. The response in blood flow will be imaged and quantified using the Perimed Laser Doppler Imager (PeriScan PIMII; Perimed, Sweden).\n\nAnalysis of AGE:\n\nAn AGE reader, which utilizes the principle of skin autofluorescence, will measure the accumulation of AGE in the skin. This validated device provides a real-time, non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular risk for chronic diseases like Diabetes, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, etc. AGE-modified proteins have autofluorescent properties and when excited by ultraviolet (UV) light they emit fluorescence in particular wavelengths. The levels of AGE in skin correlate with AGE levels in blood.\n\nThe volar aspect of the forearm will be placed on the AGE reader, which is equipped with a UV light source. The UV light triggers AGE in skin, after penetrating 1mm of the dermis, to emit autofluorescence that is then detected by the AGE reader. The intensity of fluorescence correlates with the quantity of AGE in the skin.\n\nAssessment of calcaneal BMD:\n\nThis is a simple and convenient method to assess peripheral BMD and assess fracture risk. The device used is a quantitative ultrasound called Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer (Sahara Clinical Bone Sonometer; Hologic, Waltham, MA). The calcaneus is the preferred peripheral site to assess fracture risk. This device uses ultrasound waves to determine the BMD of the calcaneus. In this procedure, once the bare heel is placed in the device, the BMD is calculated within 30 seconds and the results are then generated on paper by the device.",

    "detailed_description": "Advances in medical treatment options over the past several decades have translated into substantially higher survival rates for those who suffer with chronic illness. Consequently, the prevalence of chronic illness has risen significantly in recent years, such that one out of every four youth in the United States currently lives with a chronic illness. The health and well-being of these youth is directly impacted by the degree to which they adhere to their treatment regimen. However, treatment regimens for chronic illness can be highly complex, making adherence problematic, particularly when combined with deficits in memory and executive functioning concomitant with many chronic illnesses. Adherence also tends to deteriorate over time; the youth's motivation or commitment to treatment may decline as symptoms improve or negative side effects occur. With low adherence comes worsening symptoms and significantly greater risk for serious medical complications and mortality in young adulthood. The costs associated with low adherence, such as the need for additional care, are also substantial both for the patient and society.\n\nWhile a number of factors have been found to impact treatment adherence, risk for non-adherence-across varied forms of chronic illness-is markedly elevated when the youth lacks disease- and treatment-related knowledge and when parents provide little supervision for carrying out regimen tasks. With nearly 90% of youth with chronic illness expected to survive and therefore transition from pediatric care into adult-focused healthcare systems, it is critically important to empower youth to take ownership of their own healthcare. To do so, we need to provide accessible, affordable tools that can effectively increase patients' skills and knowledge for managing their illness and support on-going adherence to their treatment regimen.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet T1D, a mobile and web-based technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' type 1 diabetes disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through real-world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness of the Planet T1D mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease-related knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of these variables in youth with type 1 diabetes.\n\nAll participants will complete study measures at pre- and post-assessment time points. In total, participants will take part in this study for approximately 2 months from pre- to post-assessment. Families will be recruited to participate in either the treatment condition or the control group. Families in the treatment condition will receive the Planet T1D app and access to the associated website for the full duration of the study (2 months) between pre-test and post-test. Families in the control group will not receive access to the app and website, but instead will be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at each of the two data collection time points (pre-test, post-test).\n\nInvestigators hypothesize that greater use (i.e., dosage) and prolonged use of Planet T1D and access to the associated website will: increase disease-related knowledge, treatment adherence, self-efficacy for management of type 1 diabetes, current type 1 diabetes self-management behaviors, readiness to transition to independent self-care, and perceived benefits of type 1 diabetes treatment, while also decreasing perceived barriers to type 1 diabetes treatment. Moreover, investigators believe that improvement of these outcomes through use of Planet T1D will result in more positive mental health outcomes for patients, including higher reported quality of life. Investigators expect that those in the treatment condition will have better outcomes than those in the control group on all of these measures at both midpoint and post-assessment time points. Finally, investigators expect all participants to report high usability, quality, and value of the Planet T1D mobile app and website and to positively rate their experience with Planet T1D.",

It can be expected that patients initiating empagliflozin may differ in their characteristics from patients initiating other glucose lowering drugs (GLDs) that have been on the market longer (e.g. patients may have poorer glucose control). Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and comorbidities compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating other SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility exists that empagliflozin may be used by patients without T2DM. Therefore, this study also aims to assess the potential off-label use of empagliflozin compared to other non-insulin GLDs.",

    "detailed_description": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment adherence is complex and involves glucose monitoring, counting carbohydrates, and intensive insulin delivery via injections or insulin pump in response to food intake, exercise, and illness to achieve near-normal blood glucose levels. Evidence demonstrates that adhering to T1D treatment is challenging, especially during adolescence. Non-adherence leads to suboptimal glycemic levels that severely compromise health and quality of life. Suboptimal adherence to T1D treatment regimen is common in \\>50% of adolescents and directly related to suboptimal glycemic control, increased risk of hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis, and decreased health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The maximum benefits of current diabetes technology are limited by the knowledge, skills, adherence barriers, and non-adherence behaviors.10-14 Ultimately, adolescents have to overcome these barriers in order to benefit from technological advances. Thus, there is a clear need for behaviorally focused interventions to identify and reduce adherence barriers. The overall objective of this study is to identify adolescents with elevated adherence barriers and provide novel tailored mHealth intervention (Diabetes Journey) targeting these barriers. This study is two phases and includes a small pilot of up to 12 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (Phase 1) and a randomized controlled clinical trial (Phase 2). The randomized controlled clinical trial will examine feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of Diabetes Journey versus enhanced standard of care (control group) in approximately 256 adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Primary and secondary outcomes include adherence barriers, adherence, health-related quality of life and A1C. Satisfaction and acceptability will also be examined. Mediators and moderators will include executive functioning, diabetes distress, family conflict, depressive symptoms, fear of hypoglycemia and sleep.",

Despite being controlled for other important risk factors, diabetic patients are three times more likely to develop PD, and therefore, periodontitis has been proposed as the sixth complication of DM.\n\nBesides the effect of diabetes on DP, the reverse has also been studied over the past 15 years, through the idea that chronic and acute infections can directly affect the tissue resistance to insulin. Recent studies have provided evidence that controlling periodontal infection has an impact on improvement of glycemic control in diabetes mellitus patients. The vascularity of the inflamed periodontal tissue serves as a gateway to inflammatory mediators, pathogenic bacteria and their products into the bloodstream. Some researchers have suggested that periodontal treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2) patients, results in beneficial effect on the level of glycemic control. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis.\n\nThis research project aims to determinate the impact of periodontal therapy on metabolic control in DMT2 individuals, and determinate the possible association between periodontal disease and DMT2. For the HbA1c outcome this clinical trial had a sample size calculation estimated at 120 patients. For the inflammatory serum markers this study had a sample size estimated at 22 individuals. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of Hba1c and inflammatory serum markers. This data will highlight the possible role of periodontal therapy on DMT2 metabolic control.",

Diabetic neuropathy that occurs in 60-70% of patients with DM is reported to be the most important factor increasing the risk of diabetic foot. Determining risk factors in diabetic foot and attempting to eliminate or mitigate these factors have been found to be a simple, inexpensive and evidence-based tool that can be used at home by patients. This study will contribute to the current literature on the effectiveness of thermal assessment in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. The study was planned as a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the effect of thermal assessment on preventing diabetic foot ulcers in patients with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM). For the sample of the study, compared to those with thermal evaluation, the study reported that the probability of developing diabetic feet was 10.3 times higher than those without thermal evaluation program, 48 patients (thermal evaluation group: 24 people; control group: 24 people) were included in the study. It was decided that 30 patients were lost during data collection and 35 patients were included in each study group and the study was completed with a total of 70 patients.

    "brief_summary": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases requiring lifelong insulin therapy. Children and adolescents with T1D need regular insulin injections or the continuous insulin delivery using an insulin pump in order to keep blood glucose levels normal. We know that keeping blood sugars in the normal range will help prevent long-term diabetes-related complications involving the eyes, kidneys and heart. However, achieving treatment goals can be very difficult particularly due to the risk of low glucose levels (hypoglycaemia). One solution is to use a system where the amount of insulin injected closely matches the blood sugar levels on a continuous basis. This can be achieved by what is known as a \"closed-loop system\" where a small glucose sensor placed under the skin communicates with a computer containing an algorithm that drives a subcutaneous insulin pump. We have been testing such a system in Cambridge over the last five years in children and have found that this system is effective, and superior to usual insulin pump therapy, at maintaining tight glucose control. More recently the system has been tested overnight, in the home setting, for three weeks in adolescents during a pilot single-centre study.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate use of the closed loop system day and night over a period of 7 days (phase 1) and 21 days (phase 2) in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In the present study we are planning to study 24 (12 phase 1 ans 12 phase 2) young people aged 10-18 years on insulin pump therapy. This study will involve two 7 (phase 1) and 21 (phase 2) day home study periods, during which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by subjects usual insulin pump therapy combined with continuous glucose monitoring alone in random order. Prior to the closed-loop study period, there will be a training period in the clinical research facility, which will allow participants to familiarise themselves with the closed-loop system before going home.\n\nWe aim to to determine the effect of the closed-loop computer algorithm in keeping glucose levels between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L during the daytime and overnight.",
    "detailed_description": "The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and utility of automated closed-loop glucose control in the home setting over a short term period, including the daytime and during the activities of normal daily living. This study builds on previous and on-going studies of closed-loop systems that have been performed in Cambridge in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the clinical research facility and in the home setting. The data and experienced gained from this study will be utilised in planning future home studies.\n\nThis is an open-label, single-centre, randomised, crossover study, involving two, 7 day (phase 1) and 21 day (phase 2) home study periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by subjects' usual insulin pump therapy combined with continuous glucose monitoring in random order. A total of up to 30 children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be recruited through diabetes clinics, to allow for 12 completed subjects available for assessment in each study phase.\n\nSubjects will receive appropriate training by the research team on the safe use of the closed-loop insulin delivery system. During the training visit in a clinical research centre, subjects will be encouraged to mimic their usual daily activities and will be allowed to walk inside hospital premises. Subjects will be advised to discontinue automated closed-loop insulin delivery and follow their usual insulin pump therapy for certain activities such as periods of strenuous exercise during the 7 day (phase 1) and 21 day (phase 2) home study phase.\n\nThe primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by CGM (conservatively adjusted for potential over-estimation). Secondary outcomes are the time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics.

Patients will participate in health-professional-led group visits every other week focused on improving dietary and exercise practices to reduce weight.

For Aim 2,the study team will assess intervention spillover effects among participant's self-identified social networks. The study team will ask participants in Aim 1 to name 5 people in their social networks to participate in a survey of health behaviors at baseline and 12-months to assess health behavior practices.",
    "detailed_description": "South Asians and Africans are growing immigrant groups at high risk for diabetes in the US. South Asian (SA) (ancestry originating from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia) and Sub-Saharan African immigrant groups make up two of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the US. SAs have higher rates of T2D and cardiovascular disease than whites. Furthermore, SAs without diabetes have a high prevalence of T2D risk factors.\n\nSub-Saharan African-born immigrants (the proposed study will focus on West African (WA) countries: those originating from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo), whose population in the US has doubled every decade since 1980, are also at high risk for T2D. Dietary patterns of African immigrants are high in carbohydrates and animal protein, compared to African populations who did not immigrate.\n\nThese findings in SA and African immigrant communities challenge the well-accepted \"healthy immigrant effect\" phenomenon (that immigrants are on average healthier than native-born persons), suggesting that more tailored T2D prevention and management strategies are greatly needed to narrow the disparities in outcomes between these and other US populations. Previous trials showed that intensive lifestyle interventions (ILIs), group-based programs designed to promote weight loss through a combination of diet, activity, and behavior change, decrease T2D incidence in people with prediabetes and reduced complications among people with T2D. Additional analyses have shown that the effects of lifestyle interventions are long-lasting, even when participants gain back some of the weight lost during the program.\n\nFamily and social networks could be an important factor to improve patient activation, especially for South Asian and African immigrant men. Social networks, defined as someone with social or family ties to an individual, affect health through myriad mechanisms including social support, social influence, social engagement, and access to resources. This study aims to focus on SA and WA immigrant men as model populations to examine preferences, feasibility, and acceptability for a shared medical appointment (SMA) intervention based in primary care and developed with user-driven input and changes in healthy lifestyle practices among participants' social networks. This will be a pre-post pilot study of a 16-week lifestyle program for the mentioned immigrant groups with prediabetes or diabetes in Atlanta. Patients will participate in health-professional-led group visits every other week focused on improving dietary and exercise practices to reduce weight. Groups will be followed at baseline, 4 months and 12 months. For Aim 2, the study team will assess intervention spillover effects among participant's self-identified social networks.
